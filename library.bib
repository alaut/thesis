	abstract = {We present the formulation of the moment method applied to the determination of phase profiles of microwave beams from known amplitudes. While traditional approaches to this problem employ an iterative error-reduction algorithm, the irradiance moment technique calculates a two-dimensional polynomial phasefront based on the moments of weighted intensity measurements. This novel formulation has the very important advantage of quantifying measurement error, thus allowing for its possible reduction. The validity of the irradiance moment approach is tested and confirmed by examining a simple case of an ideal Gaussian beam with and without measurement errors. The effectiveness of this approach is further demonstrated by applying intensity measurements from cold-test gyrotron data to produce a phasefront solution calculated via the irradiance moment technique. The accuracy of these results is shown to be comparable with that obtained from the previously developed iteration method.},

As such, {LPAs} draw considerable attention as potential drivers for next generation light sources and for a compact linear collider. In order to asses the viability of an {LPA} source for a particular application, the brightness of the source should be properly characterized. In this paper, we present charge dependent transverse emittance measurements of {LPA} sources using both ionization injection and shock induced density down ramp injection, with the latter delivering smaller transverse emittances by a factor of two when controlling for charge density. The single shot emittance method is described in detail with a discussion on limitations related to second order transport effects. The direct role of space charge is explored through a series of simulations and found to be consistent with experimental observations.},

	abstract = {Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is the world’s most widely used medical isotope. Current production methods involve the irradiation of highly enriched uranium ({HEU}) and low enriched uranium ({LEU}) targets in nuclear reactors. Molybdenum-99 (Mo99) is then extracted from these targets, which decays to Tc-99m. Currently, this process is centralized, as there are very few companies that manufacture Mo-99. In an effort to eradicate the need for uranium to produce this medical isotope, naturally occurring molybdenum was studied to produce Mo-99. Preliminary testing at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory included irradiating naturally occurring Mo coupons for varying amounts of time using a D-T neutron generator producing 1.5x108 n/sec to produce Mo-99. Exploiting this technique, Tc-99m was successfully produced. Proof of principle testing is also underway to confirm the ability to produce Mo-99 from Mo-100 using high-energy gamma rays. Future work consists of creating a mobile device that is able to produce Tc-99m on demand, allowing for a distributed system of the medical isotope in hospitals and radio pharmacies worldwide.},

	abstract = {We report the results of experimental and numerical-simulation studies of shielded radiography using narrowband {MeV}-energy X-rays from a compact all-laser-driven inverse-Compton-scattering X-ray light source. This recently developed X-ray light source is based on a laser-wakeﬁeld accelerator with ultrahigh-ﬁeld gradient ({GeV}/cm). We demonstrate experimentally high-quality radiographic imaging (image contrast of 0.4 and signal-to-noise ratio of 2:1) of a target composed of 8-mm thick depleted uranium shielded by 80-mm thick steel, using a 6-{MeV} X-ray beam with a spread of 45\% ({FWHM}) and 107 photons in a single shot. The corresponding dose of the X-ray pulse measured in front of the target is \$100 {nGy}/ pulse. Simulations performed using the Monte-Carlo code {MCNPX} accurately reproduce the experimental results. These simulations also demonstrate that the narrow bandwidth of the Compton X-ray source operating at 6 and 9 {MeV} leads to a reduction of deposited dose as compared to broadband bremsstrahlung sources with the same end-point energy. The X-ray beam’s inherently low-divergence angle (\$mrad) is advantageous and effective for interrogation at standoff distance. These results demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁts of all-laser driven Compton X-rays for shielded radiography.},

	title = {Measurements of electromagnetic properties of ferrites as a function of frequency and temperature},
	abstract = {Fast kicker magnets are used to inject beam into and extract beam out of the {CERN} accelerator rings. These kickers are often ferrite loaded transmission line type magnets with a rectangular shaped aperture through which the beam passes. The interaction of the beam with the resistive part of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance leads to power dissipation and heating of diﬀerent elements in the accelerator ring. In particular, power deposition in the kicker magnets can be a limitation: if the temperature of the ferrite yoke exceeds the Curie temperature, the beam will not be properly deﬂected. In addition, the imaginary portion of the beam coupling impedance contributes to beam instabilities. A good knowledge of electromagnetic properties of materials up to {GHz} frequency range is essential for a correct impedance evaluation. This paper presents the results of transmission line measurements of complex initial permeability and permittivity for diﬀerent ferrite types. We present an approach for deriving electromagnetic properties as a function of both frequency and temperature; this information is required for simulating ferrite behaviour under realistic operating conditions.},

	abstract = {We present the formulation and experimental results of a new approach to designing internal mode converter reﬂectors for high-power gyrotrons. The method employs a numerical phase retrieval algorithm that reconstructs the ﬁeld in the mode converter from intensity measurements, thus accounting for the true ﬁeld structure in shaping the beam-forming reﬂectors. An outline for designing a four-reﬂector mode converter is presented and generalized to the case of an offset-fed shaped reﬂector antenna. The requisite phase retrieval and reﬂector shaping algorithms are also developed without reference to speciﬁc mode converter geometry. The design approach is applied to a 110 {GHz} internal mode converter that transforms the {TE}22;6 gyrotron cavity mode into a Gaussian beam at the gyrotron window. Cold test experiment results of the mode converter show that a Gaussian beam with the desired amplitude and phase is formed at the window aperture. Subsequent high-power tests in a 1 {MW} gyrotron conﬁrm the Gaussian beam observed in cold tests. The general development of the approach and its validation in a quasioptical mode converter indicate that it is also applicable to other quasi-optical, microwave applications such as radio astronomy, free-space transmission lines, and mitre bends for overmoded waveguides.},

	abstract = {A {CW} high power linear accelerator can only work with very low particles losses and structure activation. At low energy, the {RFQ} is a very sensitive element to losses. To design the {RFQ}, a good understanding of the beam dynamics is requested. Generally, the reference code {PARMTEQM} is enough to design the accelerator. {TOUTATIS} has been written with goals of crosschecking results and obtaining a more reliable dynamics. This paper relates the different numerical methods used in the code. It is time-based, using multigrids methods and adaptive mesh for a fine description of the forces without being time consuming. The field is accurately calculated through a Poisson solver and the vanes are fully described, allowing to properly simulate the coupling gaps and {RFQs} extremities. Differences with {PARMTEQM} and {LIDOS}.{RFQ} are shown.},

It is widely recognized as a respiratory pathogen, but neurologic complications can be the presenting manifestation in a subset of infected patients. Case presentation: We describe a 78-year old immunocompromised woman who presented with altered mental status after witnessed seizure-like activity at home. She was found to have {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and associated neuroinflammation. In this case, we undertake the first detailed analysis of cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) cytokines during {COVID}-19 infection and find a unique pattern of inflammation in {CSF}, but no evidence of viral neuroinvasion. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that neurologic symptoms such as encephalopathy and seizures may be the initial presentation of {COVID}-19. Central nervous system inflammation may associate with neurologic manifestations of disease.},

This technique selectively measures the translational mobility of water within a volume extending 0.5–1.5 nm outward from a nitroxide radical spin probe that is attached to a targeted site of a macromolecule. It allows one to study the dynamics of water that hydrates or permeates the surface or interior of proteins, polymers, and lipid membrane vesicles.},

	abstract = {Applications of nearly monoenergetic photon sources at {MeV} energies, produced by Thomson scattering of laser light from relativistic electron beams, are presently restricted to fixed facilities. Compact sources are important, but require laser development to power three enabling components: laser-plasma accelerator ({LPA}), scattering laser, and active electron beam dump. Recent experiments establishing a baseline for the accelerator have shown that tuning the spot quality over the full focal depth of the laser greatly improves {LPA} performance compared to optimizing the spot at the focal plane only. This enables Joule-class, 40 femtosecond pulsed lasers to drive the accelerator at the 0.2-0.5 {GeV} energy class, in agreement with the predictions of simulations. Designs for Thomson scattering sources utilizing the unique properties of {LPAs} also permit use of Joule-class scattering lasers, with ps pulse length. The size of the beam dump required for the high energy electrons can further be mitigated by deaccelerating the electrons in the plasma structure (with similar laser requirements to the accelerator). Joule class laser development at {kHz} repetition rates and with 0.04 to 10 ps pulse lengths would thus enable important new applications in nuclear nonproliferation, physics, and contraband detection. These requirements are a stepping stone to future systems relevant to high energy physics colliders.},

This lecture starts with a brief historical introduction and an explanation on how to get from Maxwell’s equations to a simple cavity. Then, cavities will be classiﬁed by the type of mode that is employed for acceleration, and an explanation is given as to why certain modes are used in particular cavity types. The lecture will close with a comparison of normal versus superconducting cavities and a few words on the actual power consumption of superconducting cavities.},

In this report I present a new geometrical approach for modeling and understanding various abstract, natural, and man-made shapes. Starting from the concept of the circle, I show that a large variety of shapes can be described by a single and simple geometrical equation, the Superformula. Modiﬁcation of the parameters permits the generation of various natural polygons. For example, applying the equation to logarithmic or trigonometric functions modiﬁes the metrics of these functions and all associated graphs.

It will soon be moved to the demonstrator site. The {IPHI} prototype is developed by a {CEA}/{DSM} – {CNRS}/{IN}2P3 collaboration for several applications based on the use of High Power Proton Accelerators. The aim of the source is to produce up to 100 {mA} cw beams at 95 {keV} at the {RFQ} matching point. {SILHI} has been producing intense beams since 1996 and different beam line diagnostics allow beam characterization. A new extraction system and new control system led to large improvements in term of intensity, beam line transmission, stability. More than 130 {mA} are now routinely produced at 95 {keV}. This article will report a summary of the proton beam analysis, in cw and pulsed modes, pointing out parameters such as reliability, emittance, beam noise, stability. Deuteron pulsed beams (135 {mA}-95 {kV}) were also produced in the framework of the {CEA} participation to the {IFMIF} project. The deuteron beam performance will also be presented.},

Starting from these outcomes, the rf study of the {RFQ}, aimed at determining the optimum design of the cavity shape, was performed. The stabilization issues were also addressed, through the analysis of the {RFQ} sensitivity to geometrical errors, by means of perturbative theory-based algorithms developed for this purpose . Moreover the determination of the main 3D details of the structure was also carried out. In this article the results of the rf studies concerning the abovementioned topics are outlined.},

Conventional oscillator and transmission methods are compared, and a systematic error of the oscillator method is explained. A more sensitive null method is described. A definition of the transverse R/Q is given, from which it follows that the knowledge of the longitudinal electric field component is sufficient to detersnine the deflecting properties of a structure. The accuracy of perturbation measurements was tested on a cavity for which the R/Q was known from computer calculations and deflection tests. It was found that the various valnes agree to witbin 20 percent. Perturbation measurements of deflectors with small coupling holes showed the theoretically predicted interaction parameters.

As an alternative, we suggest that the deuterium beam achievable from a compact high intensity {ECR} source can be injected directly into a compact {RFQ} to produce a more efficient compact neutron production system. Only the d
              +
              ions are accelerated by the {RFQ}, which can also produce much higher output energies than electrostatic systems, resulting in a higher neutron output with a longer target lifetime. The direct injection of the beam makes the system more compact than the multielement, electrostatic systems typically used for extraction of the beam and subsequent transport and matching into the {RFQ}. We have designed and optimized a combined extraction/matching system for a compact high current deuterium {ECR} ion source injected into a high frequency {RFQ} structure, allowing a beam of about 12 {mA} of d
              +
              ions to be injected at a modest ion source voltage of 25 {kV}. The end wall of the {RFQ} resonator serves as the ground electrode for the ion source, resembling {DPI} (direct plasma injection). For this design, we used the features of the code {IGUN} to take into account the electrostatic field between the ion source and the {RFQ} end wall, the stray magnetic field of the {ECR} source, the defocusing space charge of the low energy deuteron beam, and the rf focusing in the fringe field between the {RFQ} vanes and the {RFQ} flange.},

The source of the millimeter wave beam is a gyrotron that can generate up to 1.5-{MW} output power with 3-µs pulselength. This unique plasma structure exists only at high pressures. With decreasing pressure, the structure changes into layers of curved plasma sheets and into more familiar diffuse plasma. A main cause of the formation of the regular array structure appears to be the reﬂection from ﬁlaments. The successive generation of conductive ﬁlaments modiﬁes the incident ﬁeld pattern and creates local hot spots upstream of the existing ﬁlaments with regular spacing of roughly a quarter wavelength.},

This technology allows to include complex cooling channels in order to achieve a significant reduction of the cycle time and to control the cooling process. Because of the low bonding temperature and force, large tools can be made in a time- and cost-effective manner. The manufacturing system is similar to the technology developed by Nakagawa et al. {wT}. Nakagawa, M. Kunieda, S.

This represents a unique possibility to investigate the injection of a high current proton beam into a low energy beam transport system under the influence of space charge with conditions similar to those required in the future at {GSI}. Therefore, measurements on various beam parameters have been performed at the end of the {SILHI} {LEBT} system by a {CEA}/{IAP}/{GSI} collaboration. Results of these measurements reveal that a proton current of 100 {mA} can be achieved but the emittance is as high as 0.4-0.5 π mm mrad (95 \%, normalized, rms).},

We introduce a Gaussian beam mode analysis with Effective Refractive Index Approximation ({EIA}) applied to planar waveguides. The wavelength-scale waveguides in {NPICs} lead to large diffraction angle of the input beam and phase aberration in the reﬂected beam. However, this aberration can be shown to be negligible under ﬁrst order approximation ({FOA}). With the Gaussian beam formulation, we study the Near Field and Far Field scenarios in the incident and reﬂected beams and propose a design methodology that utilizes the two scenarios to minimize footprint of associated devices. Speciﬁcally, we use Finite-Difference Time-Domain ({FDTD}) simulation to show that applying such methodology in designing a waveguide crossing using elliptical reﬂectors not only minimizes the device footprint but also creates a novel crossing that outperforms the conventional Direct Waveguide Crossing ({DWC}) in terms of the lowest order mode transmission efﬁciency and crosstalk.},

Experiments to study the interaction of the electron beam with the xray converter are being performed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ({LLNL}) using the 6-{MeV}, 2-{kA} Experimental Test Accelerator ({ETA}) electron beam. The physics issues of greatest concern can be separated into two categories. The multiple pulse issue involves the interaction of subsequent beam pulses with the expanding plasma plume generated by earlier pulses striking the xray converter. The plume expands at several millimeters per microsecond and defines the minimum transverse spacing of the pulses. The single pulse issue is more subtle and involves the extraction of light ions by the head of the beam pulse. These light ions might propagate at velocities of several millimeters per nanosecond through the body of the incoming pulse resulting in a moving focus prior to the converter. In this paper we describe Faraday cup measurements performed to quantify the plasma plume expansion and velocities of light ions.},

Several adaptive mesh reﬁnement ({AMR})-enabled, large edge simulation ({LES})-based, simulations of a full-size disk-gapband ({DGB}) parachute inﬂating in the low-density, low-pressure, carbon dioxide ({CO}2) Martian atmosphere are reported. The comparison of the drag histories and the ﬁrst peak forces between the simulation results and experimental data collected during the {NASA} Curiosity Rover’s Mars atmospheric entry shows reasonable agreements. Furthermore, a rudimentary material failure analysis is performed to provide an estimate of the safety factor for the parachute decelerator system. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of using Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) and Fluid-Structure Interaction ({FSI})-based simulation tools for future supersonic parachute design.},

It is shown in this review that the concept of the atomic nucleus changed as a large amount of experimental data was accumu lated, understood, and theoretically analyzed. As a result, new types of interactions that were previously unknown in physics, such as the strong and weak interactions, were discovered; new phenomena associated with the mutual transformation of the particles were revealed; new types of symmetry, particularly spatial symmetry, were found; and new experimental methods were developed. As well, accelerators, which made it possible to observe the variations of separate atomic nuclei for the first time, were designed. Investigation of the properties of atomic nuclei opened a new world, viz., the subatomic quantum world. This knowledge is important in natural sciences, from the investigation of living organisms to astrophysics.},

Then, we assess the effect of the neutron ﬂux perturbation on the possible loss of detection efﬁciency. The most important part of this work is the assessment how the energy spectrum of a ﬁssion chamber is affected by the so-called self-absorption of the ﬁssion products in the ﬁssile coating. We present a Monte Carlo code we developed in order to achieve that goal. That numerical tool allowed us to reveal the linear relation between the sensitivity loss and the coating thickness, with a slope of 8\%/(mg/cm2). Numerical results are discussed with respect to experimental data and a need of new experiments is expressed. Finally, we showed the frequent assumption of the straight trajectory of ﬁssion products is not valid for a small fraction of those particles which have a kinetic energy less than 20 {keV}/amu.},

In this application, it is desirable to design a horn that has a nearly perfect circularly symmetric pattern (i.e., identical E- and H-plane patterns), with zero or low cross-polarization, a speciﬁed beam width, and a low return loss at the design frequency range. A parametric study of the corrugated horns, however, shows that the objective function relating the pattern shape, beam width and return loss is a nonlinear function of the corrugation dimensions with many local optima. As a result one has to resort to global optimization techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, for successful design of such antennas. Here, an evolutionary programming ({EP}) algorithm is used to optimize the pattern of a corrugated circular horn subject to various constraints on return loss, antenna beam width, pattern circularity, and low cross-polarization. Examples of design synthesis for a few corrugated horns are presented. The results show excellent and efﬁcient optimization of the desired horn parameters.},

Problems that can be encountered include substantial signal loss, geometric distortion of the image, incomplete fat suppression, and poor linewidth in spectroscopic measurements. To counter these problems scanner hardware is increasingly being provided with the capability for subject-specific optimization of the room-temperature shim currents. However, the conventional terms (usually only available up to 2nd order spatial harmonics) are unable to correct many practically encountered magnetic field inhomogeneities. As such, there is increasing interest in developing other methods that can provide a higher spatial frequency of correction.

The proﬁle of such a launcher is built from a novel combination of a periodic harmonic wall perturbation followed by a mirror-line-type deformation, so we named it hybrid-type launcher. The synthesis method has been tested to design a hybrid-type launcher to transform the {TE}32,9 mode of the {ITER} {EU} 1-{MW} gyrotron operating at 170 {GHz}. The simulation results show that the fundamental Gaussian mode content ({FGMC}) of the millimeter-wave beam at the radiating aperture of the hybrid-type launcher is approximately 99.1\%. In comparison with the corresponding harmonically deformed launcher, the simulations results reveal that the launcher with hybrid-type surface contour provides higher conversion efﬁciency combined with low diffraction loss (0.7\%). The computation time for the design of hybrid-type launchers is just half of that for mirror-line launchers. In the case of not very short launchers, hybrid-type launchers can provide high {FGMCs} of {RF} beams with low diffraction losses that are comparable with those of mirror-line launchers.},

Using a compact hybrid magnet with integrated shim coils to improve the magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity we are able to routinely obtain proton linewidths of less than 4 Hz and enhancement factors {\textgreater}30. The excellent ﬁeld resolution allows us to perform chemical-shift resolved {ODNP} experiments on ethyl crotonate to observe proton J-coupling.

	abstract = {Learning vector calculus techniques is one of the major missions to be accomplished by physics undergraduates. However, beginners report various difficulties dealing with the index notation due to its bulkiness. Meanwhile, there have been graphical notations for tensor algebra that are intuitive and effective in calculations and can serve as a quick mnemonic for algebraic identities. Although they have been introduced and applied in vector algebra in the educational context, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no publications that employ the graphical notation to three-dimensional Euclidean vector calculus, involving differentiation and integration of vector fields. Aiming for physics students and educators, we introduce such "graphical vector calculus," demonstrate its pedagogical advantages, and provide enough exercises containing both purely mathematical identities and practical calculations in physics. The graphical notation can readily be utilized in the educational environment to not only lower the barriers in learning and practicing vector calculus but also make students interested and self-motivated to manipulate the vector calculus syntax and heuristically comprehend the language of tensors by themselves.},

	abstract = {In this work an attempt is made to understand theoretically the trigger mechanism of a Pierce-type hydrodynamic instability found experimentally in thermionic discharges at low pressure. Particle-in-cell simulations are used to obtain detailed information about plasma parameters such as phase space and potential distributions. In contrast to earlier studies, the simultaneous inﬂuence of the ion dynamics, collisions with neutrals, and the sheath capacitance is taken into account. This is done by adopting the Lagrangian description of a general Pierce diode model developed previously. The new results obtained are threefold. First, few ion–neutral collisions prevent the coupling between electron and ion dynamics on the electronic time-scale thus removing oscillatory growing Pierce–Buneman modes. Second, the classical Pierce-diode supplemented by an external capacitance to account for the damping effect of the sheath on the Pierce instability explains the existence of stable equilibria. It further reveals the nature of the bifurcation at the instability threshold, i.e. a Hopf bifurcation is the trigger mechanism of the non-linear relaxation oscillations observed in both simulation and experiment. Third, the transient behaviour prior to the instability onset is found to be qualitatively described within the hydrodynamic model.},

The optimization of the plasma production line, i.e. from the microwave generator to the plasma source, is a requisite to enable the scaling-up while ensuring a robust control of the equipment. In addition to the electron cyclotron resonance ({ECR}) coaxial microwave plasma source previously reported, a collisional plasma source was developed for processing at 1–100 Pa. Similar to the {ECR} plasma source, the results of measurements performed with the collisional plasma source demonstrate that plasma density and uniformity are highly dependent on the microwave power, the reactor pressure and the distance to and between plasma sources. It was demonstrated that the collisional plasma source can attain very high plasma densities, i.e. {\textgreater}1012 cm¡3 in argon and {\textgreater}1011 cm¡3 in molecular gases like O2, N2, air, H2, making it suitable for high deposition rate plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition or for high density production of reactive species.

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Electron beam based radiation sources provide electromagnetic radiation for countless applications. The properties of the radiation are primarily determined by the properties of the electron beam. Compact laser driven accelerators are being developed that can provide ultrashort electron bunches (femtosecond duration) with relativistic energies reaching toward a {GeV}. The electron bunches are produced when an intense laser interacts with a dense plasma and excites a large amplitude plasma density modulation (wakeﬁeld) that can trap background electrons and accelerate them to high energies. The short-pulse nature of the accelerated bunches and high particle energy offer the possibility of generating radiation from one compact source that ranges from coherent terahertz to gamma rays. The intrinsic synchronization to a laser pulse and unique character of the radiation offer a wide range of possibilities for scientiﬁc applications. Two particular radiation source regimes are discussed: coherent terahertz emission, and X-ray emission based on betatron oscillations and Thomson scattering.},

The launcher designed for the {TE}34,19 mode at 170 {GHz} is analyzed from 118 to 218 {GHz} with 67 modes. This investigation is a preliminary study of a launcher toward a step-tunable 2-{MW} coaxial-cavity gyrotron. Twenty-four modes with fundamental Gaussian mode content ({FGMC}) that is higher than 90\% have been found. At last, nine modes of interest are selected for {SURF}3D simulations to investigate the transmission properties of millimeter-wave beams through the output window. The results reveal that the beams have deviations of their center points at the {RF} window within only 2.1 mm, and the {FGMCs} range from 92.67\% to 96.67\%. This result indicates that even the present launcher with speciﬁc deformations designed for only one mode would be capable of a step-tunable operation.},

However, we cannot perfectly transform the operating mode into the speciﬁc set of {TE} modes of target function due to the diffraction effect of the launcher cut. In this case, we proposed a method to generate an optimized target function to improve the process of transforming the operating mode into the target set of {TE} modes.

The microstructure of both powder and compacted material has been characterised by means of optical and electron microscopy ({SEM}, {TEM}). Tensile tests performed between {RT} and 850 °C show an increase of yield strength and ultimate tensile strength by 50\% and more compared to the basic steel. The ductility values are suﬃciently high. Creep tests between 600 and 700 °C up to test times of 5000 h conﬁrm the superior creep strength of {ODS}-{EUROFER}. Impact tests reveal a similar impact behaviour to comparable {ODS} alloys, but the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature is substantially higher than that of {EUROFER} 97.

The windowless evacuated transmission lines are up to 100 m in length, with 80\% transmission efficiency. Engineering solutions were developed in specific problematic areas encountered in the development of this complex system, including: Gyrotron instability; high voltage circuit instability; gyrotron conditioning; rf beam forming and coupling to waveguide; output window vacuum seals; material control; launcher mechanics and diagnosis; polarizer mechanics; dummy loads; power measurements; polarization measurements; cooling; calorimetry; and operating controls. The system is in routine operation in support of tokamak experiments, with peak generated power of about 5 {MW} at 2 s. pulse length and about 3 {MW} for 5 s. pulses.

From the analysis results, it was found that a total {RF} loss of 273 W is lost for an input power of 200kW and a reflected {RF} power of 20kW. For an {RF} coupling coefficient, it was also found that the required specification of less than S11= -20dB is obtained by a loop size of D8mm x W16mm and a penetration depth of 45mm.},

These range from the basic processes of strong-field quantum electrodynamics to the extraordinary dynamics of the generated electron-positron plasmas. This has paved the way for several experimental proposals aimed at both fundamental studies of matter at extreme conditions and the creation of particle and radiation sources. Because of the unprecedented capabilities of such sources they have the potential to open up new opportunities for experimental studies in nuclear and quark-gluon physics. We here perform a systematic analysis of different regimes and opportunities achievable with the concept of multiple-colliding laser pulses ({MCLP}), for both current and upcoming laser facilities. We reveal that several distinct regimes could be within reach of multi-{PW} laser facilities.},

	abstract = {Direct and indirect methods of X-ray spectra determination present obstacles to their practical use since they must position either the collimator-detector assembly or the attenuators-ionization chamber, respectively, along the X-ray beam direction. These arrangements require considerable space and in many instances the detectors promptly saturate. An indirect procedure, which overcomes the aforementioned problems, is developed. It consists of the scattering of the X-ray beam from a carbon disk, which is detected simultaneously by several detectors placed away from the beam. The X-ray ﬂux reaching each of these detectors is attenuated in metal sheets of different thicknesses, thus obtaining simultaneously the attenuation curve values. A set of analytical equations are derived to calculate attenuation curves by taking into account all the absorption and elastic and inelastic scattering processes that a beam of photons undergoes when going from the X-ray tube to the detector. Users, even those who are not well acquainted with computer programming, can easily obtain the X-ray spectrum by a least square ﬁtting of a measured attenuation curve to a previously derived analytical expression. A simulated Monte Carlo program of photon transport from the X-ray tube to the detector provided simulated attenuation curves data. Analytically calculated and simulated attenuation curves for the same input spectrum wholly overlap and furthermore, reconstructed spectra from both sets of curves for different kilovoltages are also in full agreement. Finally, in addition to the importance of having the detectors out of the beam direction, the proposed arrangement features other main advantages, namely, only one X-ray tube shot is needed to obtain the required data, the physical processes involved are very well known, analytical equations are easily interpreted, and the measuring apparatuses can be comparatively simple to assemble and operate.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses methods for expanding ﬁelds radiated by arbitrary sources enclosed by a certain minimum sphere in terms of Complex Source Point ({CSP}) beams. Two diﬀerent approaches are reviewed; the ﬁrst one is based on a spectral radiation integral, where the Fourier-spectrum is obtained by far ﬁeld matching. The second approach consists of two steps: ﬁrst, the equivalence principle is applied to a sphere enclosing the real sources, and a continuous equivalent electric current distribution is obtained in terms of spherical waves; then, the continuous current is extended to complex space and its {SW} components are properly ﬁltered and sampled to generate the discrete set of {CSPs}. In both cases, the ﬁnal result is a compact ﬁnite series representation with a number of terms that matches the degrees of freedom of arbitrary radiated ﬁelds; it is particularly eﬃcient when the ﬁelds are highly directional and the observation domain is limited to a given angular sector. The fact that the {CSPs} rigorously respect Maxwell’s equations ensures the validity of the expansion from near to far zone and allows one to incorporate the {CSP} representation in a generalized admittance matrix formalism for the analysis of complex problems.},

	abstract = {Objective: The incidence of accidental or suicidal ingestion of methyl alcohol is high and methyl alcohol intoxication has high mortality. Methyl alcohol intoxication causes severe neurological sequelae and appears to be a significant problem. Methyl alcohol causes acute metabolic acidosis, optic neuropathy leading to permanent blindness, respiratory failure, circulatory failure and death. It is metabolised in the liver, and its metabolite formic acid has direct toxic effects, causing oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and increased lipid peroxidation associated with the mechanism of neurotoxicity. Methanol is known to cause acute toxicity of the central nervous system; however, the effects on peripheral neuromuscular transmission are unknown. In our study, we aimed to investigate the electrophysiological effects of experimentally induced acute methanol intoxication on neuromuscular transmission in the early period (first 24 h).
Methods: After approval by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Ege University, the study was carried out on 10 Wistar rats, each weighing about 200 g. During electrophysiological recordings and orogastric tube insertion, the rats were anaesthetised using intra-peritoneal ({IP}) injection of ketamine 100 mg kg−1 and {IP} injection of xylazine 10 mg kg−1. The rats were given 3 g kg−1 methyl alcohol by the orogastric tube. Electrophysiological measurements from the gastrocnemius muscle were compared with baseline.
Results: Latency measurements before and 24 h after methanol injection were 0.81±0.11 ms and 0.76±0.12 ms, respectively. {CMAP} amplitude measurements before and 24 h after methanol injection were 9.85±0.98 {mV} and 9.99±0.40 {mV}, respectively. {CMAP} duration measurements before and 24 h after methanol injection were 9.86±0.03 ms and 9.86±0.045 ms, respectively.
Conclusion: It was concluded that experimental methanol intoxication in the acute phase (first 24 h) did not affect neuromuscular function.},

	abstract = {We developed a Lambertson magnet and two septum magnets as the splitting devices for the new beamline at the Hadron Experimental Facility in J-{PARC}. This new beam line, now under construction, is called high-p/{COMET} beam line, and the experiments using 30 {GeV} and 8 {GeV} proton beams are planned. The required functions of the splitting devices are as follows: 1) To split a small fraction (around 10-4) of the 30 {GeV} proton beam into the high-p/{COMET} beamline (30 {GeV} mode). 2) To bend all of the 8 {GeV} proton beam into the high-p/{COMET} beamline (8 {GeV} mode). These two requirements are met by adjusting the vertical beam position at the entrance of the Lambertson magnet. In 30 {GeV} mode the Lambertson magnet is used to scrape the beam halo of the proton beam and bend the beam into the high-p/{COMET} beam line. The beam loss at the Lambertson magnet is inevitable, thus the magnet must be resistant to the radiation and heat caused by the beam loss. The magnet is composed of non-organic materials only, and equipped with two water pipes to remove the heat induced by the beam loss. The branched beam is bent further by two septum magnets at the downstream of the Lambertson magnet. The construction and the magnetic field measurements of these devices were completed in March 2015, and the installation into the beam line is planned for the summer of year 2017.},

	abstract = {In state-of-the-art positron emission ({PET}) tomography systems, application-speciﬁc integrated circuits ({ASICs}) are commonly used to precisely digitize the signals of analog silicon photo-multipliers ({SiPMs}). However, when operating {PET} electronics in a magnetic resonance ({MR}) system, one faces the challenge of mutual interference of these imaging techniques. To prevent signal deterioration along long analog signal lines, {PET} electronics with a low power consumption digitizing the signals close to the {SiPMs} are preferred. In this study, we evaluate the power consumption of the {TOFPET}2 {ASIC}. Its power consumption ranges from 3.6 to 7.2 {mW}/channel as a function of the input stage impedance and discriminator noise settings. We present an analytical model allowing to compute the power consumption of a given {ASIC} conﬁguration. The input stage impedance and discriminator noise have an impact on the coincidence resolution time, energy resolution, and photon trigger level. Since the {TOFPET}2 {ASIC} delivers state-of-the-art performance with a power consumption similar or even lower than other {ASICs} typically used for {PET} applications, it is a favorable candidate to digitize the signals of {SiPMs} in future simultaneous {PET}/{MR} systems.},

	abstract = {A laser system producing controllable and stable pulses with high-power and ultrashort duration at high repetition rate is a key component of a high energy laser-plasma accelerator ({LPA}). Precise characterization and control of laser properties are essential to understanding laser-plasma interactions required to build a 10 {GeV} class {LPA}. This paper discusses the diagnostics, control and performance parameters of a 1 Hz, 1 petawatt ({PW}) class laser at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator ({BELLA}) facility. The {BELLA} {PW} laser provided up to 46 J on target with a 1\% level energy ﬂuctuation and 1.3 µrad pointing stability. The spatial proﬁle was measured and optimized by using a camera, wave front sensor, and deformable mirror ({ILAO} system). The focus waist was measured to be r0 = 53 µm and a fraction of energy within the circular area deﬁned by the ﬁrst minimum of the diffraction pattern (r = 67 µm) was 0.75. The temporal proﬁle was controlled via the angle of incidence on a stretcher and a compressor, as well as an acousto-optic programmable dispersive ﬁlter ({DAZZLER}). The temporal pulse shape was measured to be about 33 fs in full width at half maximum ({WIZZLER} and {GRENOUILLE} diagnostics). In order to accurately evaluate peak intensity, the energy-normalized peak ﬂuence and energynormalized peak power were analyzed for the measured spatial and temporal mode proﬁles, and were found to be 15 {kJ}/(cm2 J) with 6\% ﬂuctuation (standard deviation) and 25 {TW}/J with 5\% ﬂuctuation for 46 J on-target energy, respectively. This yielded a peak power of 1.2 {PW} and a peak intensity of 17×1018 W/cm2 with 8\% ﬂuctuation. A method to model the pulse shape for arbitrary compressor grating distance with high accuracy was developed. The pulse contrast above the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission pedestal was measured by {SEQUOIA} and found to be better than 109. The ﬁrst order spatiotemporal couplings ({STCs}) were measured with {GRENOUILLE}, and a simulation of the pulse’s evolution at the vicinity of the target was presented. A maximum pulse front tilt angle of less than 7 mrad was achieved. The reduction of the peak power caused by the ﬁrst order {STCs} was estimated to be less than 1\%. The capabilities described in the paper are essential for generation of high quality electron beams.},

	abstract = {Applications of high-power Terahertz ({THz}) sources require lowloss transmission lines to minimize loss, prevent overheating and preserve the purity of the transmission mode. Concepts for {THz} transmission lines are reviewed with special emphasis on overmoded, metallic, corrugated transmission lines. Using the fundamental {HE}11 mode, these transmission lines have been successfully implemented with very low-loss at high average power levels on plasma heating experiments and {THz} dynamic nuclear polarization ({DNP}) nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) experiments. Loss in these lines occurs directly, due to ohmic loss in the fundamental mode, and indirectly, due to mode conversion into high order modes whose ohmic loss increases as the square of the mode index. An analytic expression is derived for ohmic loss in the modes of a corrugated, metallic waveguide, including loss on both the waveguide inner surfaces and grooves. Simulations of loss with the numerical code {HFSS} are in good agreement with the analytic expression. Experimental tests were conducted to determine the loss of the {HE}11 mode in a 19 mm diameter, helically-tapped, three meter long brass waveguide with a design frequency of 330 {GHz}. The measured loss at 250 {GHz} was 0.029 ± 0.009 {dB}/m using a vector network analyzer approach and 0.047 ± 0.01 {dB}/m using a radiometer. The experimental results are in reasonable agreement with theory. These values of loss, amounting to about 1\% or less per meter, are acceptable for the {DNP} {NMR} application. Loss in a practical transmission line may be much higher than the loss calculated for the {HE}11 mode due to mode conversion to higher order modes caused by waveguide imperfections or miter bends.},

This approach can generate a beam with high Gaussian content and low diffraction losses. However, by adjusting the mode amplitudes to obtain a Gaussian-like distribution of the ﬁeld in the radial (instead of the azimuthal) direction, designs with signiﬁcantly less diffraction loss, reduced beam divergence angles, and higher Gaussian beam content can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Vortex Acceleration ({MVA}) from near critical density targets is one of the promising schemes of laser-driven ion acceleration. 3D particle-in-cell simulations are used to explore a more extensive laser-target parameter space than previously reported in the literature as well as to study the laser pulse coupling to the target, the structure of the ﬁelds, and the properties of the accelerated ion beam in the {MVA} scheme. The efﬁciency of acceleration depends on the coupling of the laser energy to the self-generated channel in the target. The accelerated proton beams demonstrate a high level of collimation with achromatic angular divergence, and carry a signiﬁcant amount of charge. For petawatt-class lasers, this acceleration regime provides a favorable scaling of the maximum ion energy with the laser power for the optimized interaction parameters. The megatesla-level magnetic ﬁelds generated by the laser-driven coaxial plasma structure in the target are a prerequisite for accelerating protons to the energy of several hundred mega-electron-volts.},

The terahertz radiations are invisible to naked eye \& in comparison with Xray they are intrinsically safe, non-destructive and non-invasive. This is such a new ﬁeld that researchers around the world race to build the ﬁrst practical system. It resolves many of the questions left unanswered by complementary techniques, such as optical imaging, Raman and infrared. Terahertz spectroscopy has number of applications run from detecting defects in tablet coating, product inspection (industry), spectroscopy (chemistry, astronomy), material characterization (physics), weapons concealed under clothing (airports), detection of cancer and caries. In the pharmaceutical industries it enables nondestructive, internal, chemical analysis of tablets, capsules and other dosage forms. This paper tries therefore not only to provide a brief overview over the imaging technology, but also over the whole range of current systems and research in terahertz technology.},

	abstract = {Background. We analysed genetic and environmental inﬂuences on self-esteem and its stability in adolescence.
Method. Finnish twins born in 1983–1987 were assessed by questionnaire at ages 14 (n=4132 twin individuals) and 17 years (n=3841 twin individuals). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg global self-esteem scale and analyzed using quantitative genetic methods for twin data in the Mx statistical package.
Results. The heritability of self-esteem was 0.62 [95 \% conﬁdence interval ({CI}) 0.56–0.68] in 14year-old boys and 0.40 (95 \% {CI} 0.26–0.54) in 14-year-old girls, while the corresponding estimates at age 17 were 0.48 (95 \% {CI} 0.39–0.56) and 0.29 (95 \% {CI} 0.11–0.45). Rosenberg self-esteem scores at ages 14 and 17 were modestly correlated (r=0.44 in boys, r=0.46 in girls). In boys, the correlation was mainly (82 \%) due to genetic factors, with residual co-variation due to unique environment. In girls, genetic (31 \%) and common environmental (61 \%) factors largely explained the correlation.
Conclusions. In adolescence, self-esteem seems to be diﬀerently regulated in boys versus girls. A key challenge for future research is to identify environmental inﬂuences contributing to self-esteem during adolescence and determine how these factors interact with genetic inﬂuences.},

Here, an ellipsoidal mirror is designed and characterized in order to decrease the size of the beam, thereby avoiding the scattering problems, even when relatively small samples are used. In the experimental configuration, both the emitting antenna and sample are located at the mirror focuses. Since both the emitted and reflected (focused) beams are Gaussian in nature, we make use of Gaussian beam theory to carry out the design. The mirror parameters are optimized by numerical simulations ({COMSOL} Multiphysics®) and then experimentally tested. An experimental setup is presented for dielectric, magnetic and chiral measurement in the 4.5–18 {GHz} band.},

The {RFQ} is designed to accelerate the H- beam from the energy of 65 {keV} to 2.5 {MeV}, while bunching it at 402.5 {MHz}. This high duty factor (6\%) structure is made of a combination of Glidcop® and {OFE} copper and is fully brazed. The {RFQ} is built in 4 modules, each approximately one meter long. This paper covers the mechanical fabrication details of the modules, three of which have been completed. While the modules are coming out of production, they are conditioned and tested to full power. This paper will also describe the results of the beam tests on the first module, including capture efficiency and transmission.},

	abstract = {Narrow bandwidth, high energy photon sources can be generated by Thomson scattering of laser light from energetic electrons, and detailed control of the interaction is needed to produce high quality sources. We present analytic calculations of the energy-angular spectra and photon yield that parametrize the inﬂuences of the electron and laser beam parameters to allow source design. These calculations, combined with numerical simulations, are applied to evaluate sources using conventional scattering in vacuum and methods for improving the source via laser waveguides or plasma channels. We show that the photon ﬂux can be greatly increased by using a plasma channel to guide the laser during the interaction. Conversely, we show that to produce a given number of photons, the required laser energy can be reduced by an order of magnitude through the use of a plasma channel. In addition, we show that a plasma can be used as a compact beam dump, in which the electron beam is decelerated in a short distance, thereby greatly reducing radiation shielding. Realistic experimental errors such as transverse jitter are quantitatively shown to be tolerable. Examples of designs relevant to nuclear resonance ﬂuorescence and photoﬁssion are provided.},

Therefore, we use corrugated Gaussian profiled horn antennas to improve the size and sidelobe level simultaneously. Because of compact design of this horn, it is not expected to have a good symmetry in E and H planes. The obtained radiation patterns are sufficient for desired applications. The proposed corrugated antenna has a longitudinal section composed of a normal corrugated horn, some straight corrugations, and a Gaussian profile to complete transition between waveguide and the free space.},

We changed the lower of two discriminator thresholds (D T1) in the timing branch from vth t1 = 5-30. The overvoltage was varied in a range of 1.25 V-7.25 V. The ambient temperature was kept at 16 ◦C. For all measurements, we performed an energy calibration including a correction for saturation. We evaluated the energy resolution, the coincidence resolving time ({CRT}) and the coincidence rate. At an overvoltage of 6 V, we obtained an energy resolution of about 10\% {FWHM}, a {CRT} of approximately 210 ps {FWHM} and 400 ps {FWTM}, the coincidence rate showed only small variations of about 5\%. To investigate the inﬂuence of the ambient temperature, it was varied between 12 ◦C-20 ◦C. At 12 ◦C and an overvoltage of 6.5 V, a {CRT} of approx. 195 ps {FWHM} and an energy resolution of about 9.5\% {FWHM} could be measured. Observed satellite peaks in the time difference spectra were investigated in more detail. We could show that the location of the satellite peaks is correlated with a programmable delay element in the trigger circuit.},

The {TL} is defined here as the corrugated waveguide system connecting the gyrotron mirror optics unit ({MOU}) to the entrance of the {ECH} launcher and includes miter bends and other corrugated waveguide components. The losses on the {ITER} {TL} have been calculated for four possible cases corresponding to having {HE}11 mode purity at the input of the {TL} of 100, 97, 90, and 80\%. The losses due to coupling, ohmic, and mode conversion loss are evaluated in detail using a numerical code and analytical approaches. Estimates of the calorimetric loss on the line show that the output power is reduced by about 5, 61\% because of ohmic loss in each of the four cases. Estimates of the mode conversion loss show that the fraction of output power in the {HE}11 mode is ;3\% smaller than the fraction of input power in the {HE}11 mode. High output mode purity therefore can be achieved only with significantly higher input mode purity. Combining both ohmic and mode conversion loss, the efficiency of the {TL} from the gyrotron {MOU} to the {ECH} launcher can be roughly estimated in theory as 92\% times the fraction of input power in the {HE}11 mode.},

The electron gun with an isolated beam forming electrode and an M-type dispenser cathode of 3.1-mm button diameter has been designed using {EGUN}, {OMNITRAK}-3-D, and {OPERA}-3-D codes. It consists of two isolated anodes, namely, control anode and ion-barrier anode, in addition to a ground accelerating anode to meet the requirement of long life and high reliability. Initially, in cathode selection, life considerations are ignored, and the gun is designed with the available cathode. Periodic permanent magnet ({PPM}) focusing has been designed using a Sm2Co17 highintensity magnet in order to reduce the size and the weight of the overall {TWT}. Conﬁned ﬂow beam focusing has been adopted. A compact, small-size electron gun assembly has been designed using a ceramic insulator and a suitable support structure with due considerations for high-voltage and thermal requirements. A high-voltage analysis has been carried out using {ESTAT} code, and a thermal analysis has been carried out using {ANSYS} code. Designed electron gun and {PPM} focusing has been experimentally validated by developing and testing a beam-stick tube with the application of rated potentials at various electrodes in a gun and a collector. The design and experimental results for the electron gun and {PPM} focusing have been found in close agreement.},

	abstract = {Four-vane {RFQ} is a general choice for the low energy injector of light ion accelerators. In this commonly used four-vane {RFQ} structure, each vane has undercuts at both ends to create open magnetic field paths that realize uniform electromagnetic fields along longitudinal direction. Meanwhile, there exists another undercut method called as double dipole ({DD}) that requires undercuts only on 2 vanes [1] that are interleaved with vanes with no undercut. The {RFQ} with {DD} cutback can provide a design option besides the traditional 4 vane cutback (4C) method. In this paper, we investigate and discuss some important {DD} {RFQ} features in detail: 1) Finite on-axis field at {DD} {RFQ} end section, 2) Dipole mode properties, and 3) Mode spectrum with respect to structure length. 3D simulation is utilized for this {DD} {RFQ} analysis.},

	abstract = {In recent years, evolutionary optimization methods such as genetic algorithms have become increasingly popular in {EM} optimization problems. However, these methods tend to have slow convergence bounds and further, they do not yield a deterministic optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a new method of using Kriging meta-modeling in conjunction with the divided rectangles ({DIRECT}) global optimizer to yield a global optimum solution. {DIRECT} yields a deterministic answer with a fast convergence bound and inherits both local and global optimization properties. This proposed hybrid optimization routine is applied here to two examples dealing with electromagnetic coupling reduction. One of them deals with minimizing coupling to sensors from antenna radiation on automobiles. The other example focuses on multi-sensor optimization subject to {RF} coupling constraints.},

Present work is devoted to experimental investigation of proton beam production from dense plasma (Ne {\textgreater} 1013 cm−3) of an {ECR} discharge sustained by 37.5 {GHz}, 100 {kW} gyrotron radiation at {SMIS} 37 facility at {IAP} {RAS}. The anticipated advantages of the {SMIS} 37 gasdynamic ion source over the current state-of-the-art proton source technology based on 2.45 {GHz} hydrogen discharges are described. Experimental result obtained with different extraction conﬁgurations i.e. single- and multi-aperture systems are presented. It was demonstrated that ultra bright proton beam with approximately 4.5 {mA} current and 0.03 π·mm·mrad normalized emittance can be produced with the single-aperture (1 mm in diameter) extraction, the corresponding brightness being 5 A/(π·mm·mrad)2. For production of high current beams a multi-aperture extractor was used resulting to a record of 200 {mA} / 1.1 π·mm·mrad normalized emittance proton beam. The species fraction i.e. the ratio of H+ to H+2 current was recorded to be {\textgreater} 90 \% for all extraction systems. A possibility of further enhancement of the beam parameters by improvements of the extraction system and its power supply is discussed.},

The presented paper exploits the capabilities of commercial software ({SIMION} 3D v.7) in tuning up some of the main parameters (current density, extraction voltage and extraction gap width) and conditions needed for the optimal design of the optical system associated with a specified ion source before its fabrication. The space-charge effects expressing the mutual repulsion of charged ions within the ion beam are also considered during the simulation. The studied subject is of great importance especially for nuclear applications etc…. This work addresses the parameteric study and conditions on the performance of an ion-beam extraction system, the trajectories of the particles in the beam being simulated by {SIMION}. Space-charge effects are accounted for and criteria allowing optimization of the system are proposed. Ion beam trajectories with and without space charge have been determined and, from the results, optimum extraction conditions have been deduced. Simulation of singly charged ion trajectories for a concave meniscus with 4 mm curvature radius was studied with and without space charge has been done using a singly charge argon ion trajectories. Firstly, for a concave meniscus with 4 mm curvature radius, the influence of the current density on the ion beam shape was investigated. Furthermore, influence of the acceleration voltage applied to the second electrode on the ion beam envelope was studied. Finally, the influence of the extraction gap width on the ion beam envelope was also studied.},

Although it is relatively easy to generate a satisfactory design for an {RFQ} linac for low beam currents, the space-charge effects pronuced by high currents dominate the design criteria. Methods have been developed to generate solutions that make suitable compromises between the effects of emittance growth, transmission efficiency, and overall structure length.

If Gaussian factorization of static density ﬂuctuations is assumed, this model can be solved without factorization approximation for any dynamic correlation function. The solution diﬀers from that obtained from the ideal mode coupling theory ({MCT}). The latter is equivalent to including only some, positive deﬁnite terms in an expression for the memory function. An approximate re-summation of the complete expression suggests that, under the assumption of Gaussian factorization of static ﬂuctuations, mobile particle’s motion is always diﬀusive. In contrast, {MCT} predicts that the mobile particle becomes localized at a high enough obstacle density. We discuss the implications of these results for models for glassy dynamics.},

This new code can handle multiple types of linac structures in a single run. This code features a more logically organized input sequence for the different linac structures and their properties. A {PARMILA} run can include sequences of beam-transport elements. In this paper, we describe the new user interface, highlighting the implementation of multiple rf structures.

The record parameters of the European megawatt-class 140-{GHz} gyrotron for the stellarator Wendelstein W7-X are as follows: 0.92-{MW} output power at 1800-s pulse duration, nearly 45\% efﬁciency, and 97.5\% Gaussian mode purity. These gyrotrons employ a cylindrical cavity, a quasi-optical output coupler, a synthetic diamond window, and a single-stage depressed collector ({SDC}) for energy recovery. In order to reduce the costs of the {ITER} 24-{MW} 170-{GHz} {ECH}\&{CD} system, 2-{MW} millimeter-wave power per gyrotron tube is desirable. Cylindrical gyrotron cavities are not suitable for the 2-{MW} power regime because of high ohmic wall losses and mode competition problems. However, in coaxial cavities, the existence of the longitudinally corrugated inner conductor reduces the problem of mode competition, thus allowing one to use even higher order modes with lower ohmic attenuation than in cylindrical cavities. Synthetic diamond windows with a transmission capability of 2-{MW} {CW} are feasible. A 2-{MW} {CW} 170-{GHz} coaxial-cavity gyrotron for {ECH}\&{CD} in {ITER} is under development in cooperation with European research institutions ({EGYC}, collaboration among the {CRPP}, Switzerland, the {KIT}, Germany, the {HELLAS}, Greece, the {CNR}, Italy, and the {ENEA}, Italy). At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ({KIT}), the short-pulse (1-ms) preprototype tube delivered 2.2 {MW} at 30\% efﬁciency (without {SDC}) with 96\% Gaussian output mode purity. Design studies for a 4-{MW} 170-{GHz} coaxialcavity gyrotron with two synthetic diamond output windows and two 2-{MW} millimeter-wave output beams for future fusion reactors are currently being performed at {KIT}. The availability of sources with fast frequency tunability would permit the use of simple ﬁxed nonsteerable mirror antennas for local current drive experiments and plasma stabilization. {IAP} Nizhny Novgorod develops in collaboration with {IPP} Garching and {KIT} an industrial multifrequency 1-{MW} gyrotron with approximately 50\% efﬁciency ({SDC}). A four-frequency tube (105, 117, 127, and 140 {GHz}) delivered 0.8 {MW} at 105 {GHz} and 0.95 {MW} at 140 {GHz} in 10-s pulses. After the installation of a broadband diamond window, this gyrotron will be operated also at the two intermediate frequencies.},

	abstract = {Successful gyrotron experiments at {FZK} employing a conventional hollow cylindrical waveguide cavity, a quasi-optical mode converter with dimple-type launcher, a broadband silicon nitride Brewster window and a single-stage depressed collector ({SDC}), gave up to 1.6 {MW} output power at efﬁciencies between 48 and 60\% for all operating mode series in the frequency range from 114 to 166 {GHz}. Frequency tuning in 3.7 {GHz} steps has been achieved by slow variation (minutes) of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the cavity. A speciﬁc hybrid magnet system for fast frequency tuning (1 s) is being manufactured. These experiments conﬁrm the preliminary results achieved with a prototype fused quartz glass Brewster window. Up to now, the pulse duration has been 1 – 5 ms. However a water-edge-cooled silicon nitride composite Brewster window with its thermal conductivity of k= 60 W/{mK}, permittivity mr = 7.85 ({qBrewster} = 70.35°), tan l = 3.5 × 10−4, excellent mechanical properties and clear window aperture of 100 mm diameter, will allow long-pulse operation (1 s) in the 1 {MW} power range. By increasing the beam current to 70 A (70\% of the limiting current!), a maximum power of 2.14 {MW}, the highest value ever generated by a weakly relativistic gyrotron, has been obtained at 140 {GHz} with an efﬁciency of 34\% (53\% with {SDC}). With a {TE}31,17 coaxial cavity gyrotron, also equipped with a quasi-optical mode converter and a {SDC}, a maximum {RF}-output power of 1.7 {MW} with an efﬁciency of 26.2\% has been achieved at a beam current Ib = 69.7 A and a cathode voltage Uc = 93.2 {kV}. Around the nominal beam parameters (Ib = 52.2 A, Uc = 91.8 {kV}, Bcav = 6.65 T) an {RF}-output power of 1.3 {MW}, with an efﬁciency of 27.2\% (41\% with {SDC}), has been measured. In experiments on frequency step tuning, also using the silicon nitride composite Brewster angle window, 19 different modes with :2.2 {GHz} frequency spacing have been excited with ] 1 {MW} power at frequencies in the range between 134 and 169.5 {GHz}. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A plasma ion source is being developed to produce a 20 {keV}, 1 {mA} H+ beam. Simulation results for ion source, transmission and beam dynamics are presented together with analytical studies performed with newly developed {RFQ} design code {DEMIRCI}. Simulation results shows that a beam transmission 99\% could be achieved at 1.7 m downstream reaching an energy of 1.5 {MeV}. As the ﬁrst phase an Aluminum {RFQ} prototype, the so-called cold model, will be built for low power {RF} characterization. In this contribution the status of the project, design considerations, simulation results, the various diagnostics techniques and {RFQ} manufacturing issues are discussed.},

We first introduce the concept of the impedance by approximating a cavity resonance by a {RLC} circuit. The response of such a resonator to pulse excitation gives the wake potential or Green function while a harmonic excitation reveals the concept and properties of the impedance. The interaction of a stationary circulating bunch with an impedance leads to an energy loss and to a shift of the incoherent synchrotron frequency. A bunch executing a synchrotron oscillation has spectral lines and harmonics of the revolution frequency with side bands spaced by the synchrotron frequency. The voltage induced in an impedance by these spectral lines can act back on the beam. A simple expression involving the impedances at the upper and lower side bands gives the growth rate of the Robinson instability. This can be generalized for a more complicated impedance, for the case of many bunches and also for higher modes of longitudinal oscillations.},

The {RFQ} reaches an energy of 5 {MeV} in only 2 meters; it is divided into four standardized modules of 500 mm, each equipped with 12 tuner ports and one {RF} input. The inner quadrant radius is 46 mm and the {RFQ} has an outer diameter of 134 mm; its total weight is only 220 kg. The beam dynamics and {RF} design have been optimized for reduced length and minimum {RF} power consumption; conventional construction technologies have been adopted, to favour a future industrial production. The multiple {RF} ports are foreseen for using either 4 solidstate units or 4 {IOT}’s as {RF} power sources. Although hadron therapy requires only a low duty cycle, the {RFQ} has been designed for 5\% duty cycle in view of other uses. This extremely compact and economical {RFQ} design opens several new perspectives for medical applications, in particular for {PET} isotopes production in hospitals with two coupled high-frequency {RFQs} reaching 10 {MeV} and for Technetium production for {SPECT} tomography with two {RFQs} followed by a {DTL}.},

	abstract = {The {ProTom} Radiance 330 proton radiotherapy system provides the most advanced proton delivery capability to date. It supports true three-dimensional beam scanning with dynamic energy and intensity modulation. Most of the protons extracted from the synchrotron are used to treat the patient, which results in minimal neutron background in the treatment room. The patient dose rate depends upon the number of protons injected and the acceleration cycle time. Therefore, one can boost the dose rate by increasing the beam intensity at injection. Improvements to the existing tandem accelerator injector are already underway. However, an alternative way to attain higher intensity beam is to use an {RFQ} linac as an injector. To this end, a novel 1.6 {MeV} {RFQ} linac has been designed to specifically satisfy the small energy acceptance limits of the synchrotron. Simulations of the beam line optics and injection matching to the synchrotron have been performed using the computer codes {PARMILA} and {TRACE}-3D to determine if an additional bunching cavity is needed. Assessments of the space charge limit at the relatively low injection energy of 1.6 {MeV} and {RF} capture simulations have also been performed. Results of these studies are presented.},

In order to test these simulations and to improve the beam matching between {ECRIS} and cyclotron we have designed and built a new pepperpot emittance meter.

	abstract = {The versatility of {ECR} (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) ion sources makes them the injector of choice for many heavy ion accelerators. However, the design of the {LEBT} (Low Energy Beam Transport) systems for these devices is challenging, because it has to be matched for a wide variety of ions. In addition, due to the magnetic conﬁnement ﬁelds, the ion density distribution across the extraction aperture is inhomogeneous and charge state dependent. In addition, the ion beam is extracted from a region of high axial magnetic ﬁeld, which adds a rotational component to the beam. In this paper the development of a simulation model (in particular the initial conditions at the extraction aperture) for {ECR} ion source beams is described. Extraction from the plasma and transport through the beam line are then simulated with the particle-in-cell code {WARP}. Simulations of the multispecies beam containing Uranium ions of charge state 18+ to 42+ and oxygen ions extracted from the {VENUS} {ECR} ion source are presented and compared to experimentally obtained emittance values.},

The 1 Tesla resonances in {LDX} form small rings encompassing the entire plasma cross-section above and below the floating coil (F-coil) near the dipole axial region. A 32.5 mm diameter {TE}01 waveguide with a partial Vlasov step cut launches a diverging beam from above the F-coil that depends on internal wall reflections for plasma coupling. Initial gyrotron only plasmas exhibit steep natural profiles with fewer hot electrons than with the other sources. The background scattered radiation suggests that only about half the power is being absorbed with the present launcher.},

To address these challenges, we propose an accelerator-driven advanced nuclear energy system ({ADANES}), consisting of a burner system and a fuel recycle system. In {ADANES}, the ideal utilization rate of nuclear fuel will be {\textgreater}95\%, and the ﬁnal disposal of nuclear waste will be minimized. The design of a high-temperature ceramic reactor makes the burner system safer. Part of ﬁssion products ({FPs}) are removed during the simple reprocessing in the fuel recycle system, signiﬁcantly reducing the risks of nuclear proliferation of nuclear technology and materials. The {ADANES} concept integrates nuclear waste transmutation, nuclear fuel breeding, and safety power production, with an ideal closed loop operation of nuclear ﬁssion energy, constituting a major innovation of great potential interest for future energy applications.},

The center frequency is 0.34THz and the bandwidth is larger than 10\%. The maximum fundamental mode Gaussian power coupling efficiency increases to approximately 99.8\% in this design. Typically, this corrugated feed horn achieves sidelobe and cross-polar levels around -37 {dB} and -50 {dB}. Both the simulation and measurement results are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed horn. The measured results meet the simulated results very well.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in tuning and stabilization of Radio Frequency Quadrupoles ({RFQ}) will be presented. New designs of {RFQs} as long as four times the free-space wavelength and requiring field flatness of a few percent and less than a few percent dipole component can now be built and tuned. The tuning is performed by measuring the {RFQ} fields with a beadpull in each quadrant and using a computer program, ({RFQPERT}) to analyze the beadpull data. The program calculates a set of perturbations to an ideal {RFQ} that would mix in nearby modes to give the measured fields. Slug tuners are then used to cancel the calculated perturbation in the real {RFQ} to get the desired pure {RFQ} mode. The pros and cons of several methods that have been used to stabilize the field in {RFQs} will also be discussed.},

This {RFQ} includes some new features in its design. It consists of four resonantly coupled 2-m-long segments that make up its 8-m length. It has higher vane-gap voltages at the highenergy end than the low-energy end. The entrance end of the {RFQ} has lower transverse focusing strength to facilitate beam matching. The exit of the {RFQ} has a transition cell and a radial-matching section. The exit radial-matching section matches the beam into the following accelerator.},

	abstract = {The radio frequency quadrupole ({RFQ}) accelerator began as ‘The ion linear accelerator with space-uniform strong focusing” conceived by I. M. Kapchinskii and V. A. Teplyakov[l]. In 1979, R. H. Stokes, K. R. Crandall, J. E. Stovall and D. A. Swenson[2] gave this concept the name {RFQ}. Shortly after Valentine’s Day in 1980 a telegram was sent to I. M. Kapchinskii. It stated, ‘The {RFQ} is alive and well at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory”. Thus begins a very informative story of the early history of the development of the {RFQ}[3]. By 1983, at least 15 laboratories throughout the world were working on various {RFQ} designs. H. Klein wrote an excellent review of a number of different {RFQ} sauctures[4]. In the early years, there were many types of geometry considered for the {RFQ}, but only a few types have survived. The two cavity geometries now used in almost all {RFQs} are the 4-vane and 4-rod smctures. The 4-vane saucture is the most popular because its operating frequeniy range (80 to -500 {MHz}) is suitable for. light ions. Heavy ions require low frequencies (below 200 {MHZ}). Because the 4-{rOd} structure has smaller transverse dimensions than a 4-vane {RFQ} at,the same frequency, the 4-rod {RFQ} is often preferred for these applications. This paper will describe how the {RFQ} accelerates and focuses the heam. The paper also discusses some of the important technical advances in designing and building {RFQs}.},

This 350-{MHz} {RFQ} is split into four 2-meter-long-{RFQ}’s. Then they are joined with resonant coupling to form an 8meter-long {RFQ}[3]. This improves both the longitudinal stability and the transverse stability of this long {RFQ}. The frequencies of the modes near the {RFQ} mode are measured. We show the effect on the {RF} fields of an error in the temperature of each one of the 2-meter-long {RFQ}’s. Water-cooled copper slugs distributed along the outer walls tune the {RFQ}. The program {RFQTUNE} [4] is used to determine the length of the slug tuners. The tuners are machined to length when the final tuning is complete.},

The ion source for the accelerator is a microwave proton source driven by a 2.45-{GHz} magnetron. Pulsed beam for the {RFQ} is accomplished by modulation of the magnetron tube current. The magnetron provides microwave pulses to the ion source, and a mediumbandwidth, extraction power supply produces the H+ ion beam using a four-electrode extractor. A similar ion source with a three-element extractor operating at 50 {kV} has also been tested with this magnetron modulator. We report the results of modulating the ion-source microwave power and extracting a pulsed proton beam using both a triode and a tetrode extractor.},

It has been used to evaluate the extraction system in order to produce an ion beam with high current and low beam emittance. The results show that the shape of the extraction electrode plays an important role in ion beam formation. Comparison has been made between two extraction systems, Pierce extraction electrode and spherical extraction electrode. The results show that the spherical extraction system yields ion extraction beam with lower emittance and radius than that the Pierce system. The simulation can provide the basis for optimizing the extraction system and the acceleration gap for ion source.},

	abstract = {A Gaussian beam-mode analysis of the operation of a corrugated feed horn is presented. The electric field over the aperture is expanded in terms of a set of Gaussian-Laguerre modes. These modes are solutions to the wave equation, in a paraxial approximation, and propagate from the aperture in a simple and well defined way. The antenna pattern of the horn in any plane in the near or far field is found by summing the contributions from the modes. This process is computationally faster than the standard Fresnel expansion, and provides a new insight into the operation of feed horns. It is particularly appropriate when the horn feeds a quasioptical system. Almost 98\% of the power is carried in the fundamental Gaussian mode. To illustrate the application of the method, an analytical expression for the position of the phase centre is derived and the coupling between two horns is calculated.},

While the development of these devices as well as clever shimming methods have yielded impressive advancements, scaling the size of these magnets to miniature lengths remains a problem to be addressed. Here we present the results of a study of a discrete shimming scheme for {NMR} Mandhalas constructed from a set of individual magnet blocks. While our calculations predict a modest reduction in ﬁeld deviation by a factor of 9.3 in the case of the shimmed ideal Mandhala, a factor of 28 is obtained in the case of the shimmed imperfect Mandhala. This indicates that imperfections of magnet blocks can lead to improved ﬁeld homogeneity. We also present a new algorithm to improve the homogeneity of a permanent magnet assembly. Strategies for future magnet construction can improve the agreement between simulation and practical implementation by using data from real magnets in these assemblies as the input to such an algorithm to optimize the homogeneity of a given design.},

The radiation pattern of the gyrotron is measured using an {IR} camera at {LHD}. The measured data is analyzed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ({MIT}) to retrieve the phase distribution of the radiation. The moments of the measured amplitude arrays are calculated to improve the reliability of the {IR} image data.

In Chapter 1 it is shown that this expansion creates grave difficulties for the Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravitation. Chapter 2 deals with perturbations of an expanding homogeneous and isotropic universe. The conclusion is reached that galaxies cannot be formed as a result of the growth of perturbations that were initially small. The propagation and absorption of gravitational radiation is also investigated in this approximation. In Chapter 3 gravitational radiation in an expanding universe is examined by a method of asymptotic expansions. The 'peeling off' behaviour and the asymptotic group are derived. Chapter 4 deals with the occurrence of singularities in cosmological models. It is shown that a singularity is inevitable provided that certain very general conditions are satisfied.},

	abstract = {The {ALICE} code was used to calculate the theoretical excitation functions for proton induced reactions on 100Mo that lead to the production of Nb, Mo and Tc isotopes. The {ALICE} code predicts a maximum cross section of the order of 100 mb for the 100Mo(p,pn)99Mo nuclear reaction. {ALICE} predicts that the production of a few Curies of 99Mo is feasible if high intensity ({mA}) protons are degraded from 50→30 {MeV} in a target of highly isotopically enriched 100Mo. The {ALICE} code can not be used to predict the cross sections for the isomeric states for the 100Mo(p,2p)99m+{gNb} → 99Mo reactions. However, the predicted cross section for protons on 100Mo to yield 99Nb suggests that the (p,2p) reaction channel does not contribute significantly to the thick target yield of 99Mo. Several considerations suggest that accelerator production of 99Mo→99mTc generators is not a practical economic alternative to fission produced 99Mo. Considerations for the cyclotron production of 99mTc are discussed.},

	abstract = {The influence of linear coupling between the transverse planes of a circular accelerator on Landau damping of coherent instabilities is assessed using two typical frequency distributions (Lorentzian and “elliptical”). These spectra are limiting cases modeling distributions with and without important tails. A general stability criterion is derived in both cases that includes the coupling strength (due to skew quadrupoles) and the tune distance from the difference resonances. It reveals the possibility of sharing the stabilising frequency spreads between the two planes. This can significantly improve the coherent beam stability, especially in cases where the situation is more critical in one plane. Another important observation is the fact that the influence of a large imaginary part in the beamenvironment impedance, which normally requires a large frequency spread for Landau damping, can be compensated (at least in one plane) by a judicious choice of the coupling. Experiments in the {CERN}-{PS} have been performed and the results confirm the general behaviour predicted by the theory. The mechanism of coupled Landau damping could therefore explain why a machine like the {CERN}-{PS} can be stabilised by tuning close to a coupling resonance and can be used to determine optimum values for the tune split and the linear coupling strength.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Antibodies serve as biomarkers of infection, but if sustained can confer long-term immunity. Yet, for most clinically approved vaccines, binding antibody titers only serve as a surrogate of protection. Instead, the ability of vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize or mediate Fc-effector functions is mechanistically linked to protection. While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question. Using a community-based surveillance study, we aimed to define the relationship between titers and functional antibody activity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 over time. Here we report significant heterogeneity, but limited decay, across antibody titers amongst 120 identified seroconverters, most of whom had asymptomatic infection. Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited {RBD}-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activity—defined by the level of antibodies—is required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response. This response activity level may be essential for durable protection, potentially explaining why re-infections occur with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and other common coronaviruses.},

Included are the Alvarez, the Wideroe, and the radio-frequency quadrupole linacs. We obtain the limiting-current formulas for both the longitudinal and the transverse degrees of freedom by assuming that the average space-charge force in the beam bunch arises from a uniformly distributed charge within an azimuthally symmetric threedimensional ellipsoid. The Mathieu equation is obtained as an approximate, but general, form for the transverse equation cf motion. The smooth-approximation method is used to obtain a solution and an expression for the transverse current limit. The form of the current-limit formulas for different linac constraints is discussed.},

In fact, this expression applies to particles with vanishing betatron amplitude in a beam with uniform transverse distribution. It is argued that an average over the transverse distribution should be used instead of the value on axis. It is shown that for the realistic ‘binomial’ family of distributions the 1 in the above expression for g should be replaced by a value near 0.5 if a is interpreted as twice the rms width of the beam.},

	abstract = {Bivariate normal distributions are often used to describe the joint probability density of a pair of random variables. These distributions arise across many domains, from telecommunications, to meteorology, ballistics, and computational neuroscience. In these applications, it is often useful to radially and angularly marginalize (i.e., under a polar transformation) the joint probability distribution relative to the coordinate system’s origin. This marginalization is trivial for a zero-mean, isotropic distribution, but is nontrivial for the most general case of a non-zero-mean, anisotropic distribution with a nondiagonal covariance matrix. Across domains, a range of solutions with varying degrees of generality have been derived. Here, we provide a concise summary of analytic solutions for the polar marginalization of bivariate normal distributions. This report accompanies a Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.) and R toolbox that provides closed-form and numeric implementations for the marginalizations described herein.},

	abstract = {Antagonistic pleiotropy, the evolutionary theory of senescence, posits that age related somatic decline is the inevitable latelife by-product of adaptations that increase ®tness in early life. That concept, coupled with recent ®ndings in oncology and gerontology, provides the foundation for an integrative theory of vertebrate senescence that reconciles aspects of the `accumulated damage' `metabolic rate', and `oxidative stress' models. We hypothesize that (1) in vertebrates, a telomeric fail-safe inhibits tumor formation by limiting cellular proliferation. (2) The same system results in the progressive degradation of tissue function with age. (3) These patterns are manifestations of an evolved antagonistic pleiotropy in which extrinsic causes of mortality favor a species-optimal balance between tumor suppression and tissue repair. (4) With that trade-off as a fundamental constraint, selection adjusts telomere {lengthsÐlonger} telomeres increasing the capacity for repair, shorter telomeres increasing tumor resistance. (5) In environments where extrinsically induced mortality is frequent, selection against senescence is comparatively weak as few individuals live long enough to suffer a substantial phenotypic decline. The weaker the selection against senescence, the further the optimal balance point moves toward shorter telomeres and increased tumor suppression. The stronger the selection against senescence, the farther the optimal balance point moves toward longer telomeres, increasing the capacity for tissue repair, slowing senescence and elevating tumor risks. (6) In iteroparous organisms selection tends to coordinate rates of senescence between tissues, such that no one organ generally limits life-span. A subsidiary hypothesis argues that senescent decline is the combined effect of (1) uncompensated cellular attrition and (2) increasing histological entropy. Entropy increases due to a loss of the intra-tissue positional information that normally regulates cell fate and function. Informational loss is subject to positive feedback, producing the ever-accelerating pattern of senescence characteristic of iteroparous vertebrates. Though telomere erosion begins early in development, the onset of senescence should, on average, be deferred to the species-typical age of ®rst reproduction, the balance point at which selection on this trade-off should allow exhaustion of replicative capacity to overtake some cell lines. We observe that captive-rodent breeding protocols, designed to increase reproductive output, simultaneously exert strong selection against reproductive senescence and virtually eliminate selection that would otherwise favor tumor suppression. This appears to have greatly elongated the telomeres of laboratory mice. With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled, these animals are unreliable models of normal senescence and tumor formation. Safety tests employing these animals likely overestimate cancer risks and underestimate tissue damage and consequent accelerated senescence. q 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for cave surveying in complete darkness with an autonomous aerial vehicle equipped with a depth camera for mapping, downward-facing camera for state estimation, and forward and downward lights. Traditional methods of cave surveying are labor-intensive and dangerous due to the risk of hypothermia when collecting data over extended periods of time in cold and damp environments, the risk of injury when operating in darkness in rocky or muddy environments, and the potential structural instability of the subterranean environment. Robots could be leveraged to reduce risk to human surveyors, but undeveloped caves are challenging environments in which to operate due to low-bandwidth or nonexistent communications infrastructure. The potential for communications dropouts motivates autonomy in this context. Because the topography of the environment may not be known a priori, it is advantageous for human operators to receive real-time feedback of high-resolution map data that encodes both large and small passageways. Given this capability, directed exploration, where human operators transmit guidance to the autonomous robot to prioritize certain leads over others, lies within the realm of the possible.},

The resulting distortion is reminiscent of the “warp drive” of science ﬁction.

Since our previous review the lower limit on the photon Compton wavelength has improved by four orders of magnitude, to about one astronomical unit, and rapid current progress in astronomy makes further advance likely. For gravity there have been vigorous debates about even the concept of graviton rest mass. Meanwhile there are striking observations of astronomical motions that do not fit Einstein gravity with visible sources. "Cold dark matter" (slow, invisible classical particles) fits well at large scales. "Modified Newtonian dynamics" provides the best phenomenology at galactic scales. Satisfying this phenomenology is a requirement if dark matter, perhaps as invisible classical fields, could be correct here too. "Dark energy" \{{\textbackslash}it might\} be explained by a graviton-mass-like effect, with associated Compton wavelength comparable to the radius of the visible universe.

	abstract = {Longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities pose a major limitation to the intensity and quality of {LHC}-type beams in the {CERN} Proton Synchrotron ({PS}). The oscillations are excited above transition energy and mainly driven by the impedance of the main accelerating cavities at around 10 {MHz}. When approaching the flat-top these cavities are partly short-circuited. However, due to the sweeping revolution frequency, the spectral components of the beam move towards the resonances of the high frequency cavities at 20 {MHz}, 40 {MHz} and 80 {MHz}. Hence different coupled-bunch oscillation mode patterns are observed during acceleration and at the flat-top. A dedicated frequency domain damping system has been installed. While dipole coupled-bunch instabilities are well suppressed, quadrupole oscillations remain, as well as longitudinal blow-up due to the impedance of the high frequency cavities. Recent results obtained with the coupled-bunch feedback are presented together with first studies using alternative mitigation techniques for the instabilities.},

It is divided into four segments and equipped with 32 tuners in total. The {RFQ} length corresponds to 5λ which is considered to be close to the limit for ﬁeld adjustment using tuners. Moreover the high frequency results in a sensitive structure and requires careful tuning by means of the alignment of the pumping ports and ﬁxed tuners. This paper gives an overview of the tuning procedure and bead pull measurements of the {RFQ}.},

	abstract = {Recent megawatt gyrotron experiments at {MIT} have achieved record powers at 170 {GHz}. Single mode emission with a peak output power of 1.5 {MW} and an efficiency of 35\% has been measured. The experiment is based on a resonant {TE}28 ,8 ,1 cylindrical cavity situated in a 6.7 T magnetic field. Microwaves are generated in the cavity by an 83 {kV} annular electron beam produced by a triode-type magnetron injection gun that is capable of currents up to 50 A. Megawatt power levels with efficiencies between 30-36\% have been measured over a wide range of operating parameters for the {TE}28 ,8 ,1 mode. Similar results were also achieved in the neighboring {TE}27,8 ,1 mode at 166.6 {GHz}, and the {TE}29,g,1 mode at 173.5 {GHz}. The high output power is the result of a carefully designed electron gun with low perpendicular velocity spread (610\%) and a novel cavity with an output iris that is less prone to mode competition. These results are in good agreement with nonlinear multimode simulations.},
