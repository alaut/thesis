\chapter{Introduction}

\section{CERN}

The European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, is an institution tasked with providing particle accelerators to scientists for purposes of conducting high energy physics experiments. It is the home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator complex, comprised primarily of LINAC4, the Proton Synchrotron (PS), Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is located across the Franco-Swiss border local to Lake Geneva, the Jura mountains, and Mont Salève.

    \label{fig:cern}
\end{figure}

The particle's produced in proton-proton collisions by the LHC can vary in charge, spin, mass, momentum, etc and accordingly the qualities of these decay products must be quantified through the use of large particle detector systems. Typically they are comprised of solenoids to probe the particle's momentum and charge, calorimeters to gauge energy, and micro-channel plates to probe time-of-flight and generalized tracking as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:cms}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/cms_detector.jpg}
    \caption{Radial evolution of particles through CMS detector, generated by collisions within the LHC}
    \label{fig:cms}
\end{figure}

In the case of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, Figure \ref{fig:cms}, proton-proton collisions emit muons, electrons, hadrons and photons which are subsequently detected and tracked by a series of nested calorimeters and micro-channel plates. Due to statistical variation of the beam collision and variability of particle interactions observed, trajectories need to be studied and analyzed over long periods of time to provide the best statistical utility for physics.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/sn-LHC.jpg}
    \caption{Internals of CERN CMS Muon Detector}
    \label{fig:cms_internals}
\end{figure}

The quality of data is correlated with the overall exposure of the detectors to collision events and so accordingly the uncertainty of certain measurements can be improved by either increasing the total integrated exposure time, or by increasing the total beam quality or luminosity $\mathcal{L}$, so that the events of interest are occurring in greater number. Accordingly, there is an ever persistent effort to improve the beam quality throughout the CERN accelerator chain, typically by increasing factors such as beam intensity, reducing bunch emittance, beam size and divergence, improve stability and variation, etc.

As particle beam's intensities are increased, the self electromagnetic fields of the charged particles within a bunch will begin to have an effect on the bunch itself. This self interaction is called space-charge, the phenomena where the very composition of a bunch can cause the bunch itself to repel apart, break up or cause other instabilities. These instabilities typically have a negative impact on the usefulness of the beam towards scientific applications and accordingly space-charge instabilities and other effects need to be effectively characterized, suppressed or otherwise mitigated.

\section{The Proton Synchrotron}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/pscomplex.png}
    \caption{Bird's eye mapping of PS complex including various linacs, PS Booster and portions of the SPS}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

Space-charge effects typically reduce with particle energy and so for higher energy accelerators, or rings with minimal bunch intensity, space-charge can be often overlooked. CERN's Proton Synchrotron however is a rather unique device in that through it's particle ramp cycle, the bunch transitions between regimes where space-charge is initially dominated to regimes where it can be effectively ignored. It is also a device which experiences the phenomena of "transition crossing", an dynamic period during the life of a particle bunch where the stability bucket jumps drastically and proactive measures must be taken to "re-catch" the bunch. Parameter's summarizing injection and extraction characteristics at flat-bottom and flat-top respectively are represented in table \ref{tab:ps_parameters}.

\input{tables/ps_params.tex}

The PS is of particular interest in that it is the first accelerator within which the phenomena of \textbf{transition crossing} was observed. It also provides an opportunity to perform experiments with highly intense proton beams over a large energy range, relevant for space charge studies. In standard operation, the configuration of RF profile ramp parameters for an LHC run is represented in Figure \ref{fig:ps_ramp}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/RF.png}
    \caption{RF Ramp sequencing for numerous harmonics}
    \label{fig:ps_ramp}
\end{figure}

Particle bunches are typically comprised of 8e+12 particles \cite{migliorati_instability_2018}, highly intense for only mildly relativistic energies.

\section{Motivation}

As will be discussed further in the text, the stability of our bunch occupies two regimes, first the space-charge dominated regime and later the regime dominated by inductive impedance. Depending on the bunch intensity and bunch length properties, these regimes produce opposing focusing/defocusing effects below transition and are observed to compensate for one another near transition.

\subsection{Space-Charge Impedance Compensation}

By an impedance budget accounting of the PS, it is estimated that the inductive impedance of the PS \textbf{is approximately 200 Ohms (??? cite impedance model)}, and so we observe in Figure \ref{fig:ps_impedance} that around a transition energy of 6 Gev, the \textbf{space charge impedance is calculated to represent approximately -170 Ohms (review this calculation again)}. This therefore defines this regime as highly dynamic and of particular interest for space-charge studies in the PS.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/energy_v_space_charge_impedance.png}
    \caption{momentum (Blue) vs. space charge impedance (blue) during PS Ramp}
    \label{fig:ps_impedance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Validation of Space-Charge Effects in Longitudinal Trackers}

When current space-charge approximations are incorporated into longitudinal tracking codes such as \href{https://blond.web.cern.ch/}{BLonD}, we can observe that the bunch length oscillations amplitude and frequency can only be matched when current space-charge calculations are reduced by roughly 30\%, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:BlonD_v_experiment}. The details of such a tracker shall be discussed later in the text. This discrepancy may suggest that there may exist an additional stabilizing phenomena within which the current model for longitudinal space-charge impedance is neglecting.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/simulation_v_experiment.png}
    \caption{Current space-charge models underestimate stabilizing effect from experiment}
    \label{fig:BlonD_v_experiment}
\end{figure}

A possible candidate to describe this discrepancy may be related to the fact that current longitudinal codes neglect betatron motion, suggesting that the variance in individual transverse particle trajectories may lead to describing new phenomena in the longitudinal plane.

\subsection{Micro-Bunch Instabilities}

Because there is a causal relationship with how space-charge fields emitted from the front of a bunch propagate toward the tails, small perturbations and density fluctuations in the bunch's longitudinal charge density profile can create local hot spots of focusing/defocusing fields which can in turn spur along further subsequent fluctuations. These fluctuations, named \textbf{micro-bunch instabilities} are a phenomena that becomes a challenge for very intense and short bunches that can rapidly destabilize an otherwise well behaved distribution.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/micro_bunching_instabilities.PNG}
    \caption{Example of micro-bunch instabilities simulated in a Longitudinal Tracking Code}
    \label{fig:microbunch_instabilities}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:microbunch_instabilities}, a narrow bunch distribution can spontaneously split due to local fluctuations in the bunch profile that have a negative feedback mechanism for promoting further instabilities. With time, the perturbations will again average out but the net effect will be the reduction in beam quality and so must be characterized and avoided.

\chapter{Beam Dynamics}

\section{Transverse Dynamics}

\subsection{Betatron Motion}

A particle's transverse position $u(s)$ within a focusing lattice, characterized by the beta function $\beta(s)$, is dependent on particle emittance $\epsilon$ and phase advance $\mu(s)$:

$$\begin{aligned}
        u(s)  & = \sqrt{\beta\epsilon}\cos\phi                            \\
        u'(s) & = -\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}}(\alpha\cos\phi+\sin\phi)
        \label{eq:hills_equations}
    \end{aligned}$$

The phase $\phi$ and phase-advanced $\mu(s)$ of a particle's oscillations through a lattice is given by:

$$\phi = \mu(s) + \mu_0 \qquad \mu(s) = \int_0^s\frac{ds}{\beta(s)}$$

Accordingly, betatron motion follows elliptical u-u' trajectories per a particle's emittance $\epsilon$ and it's twiss parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$:

$$\epsilon = \gamma x^2 + 2 \alpha x x' + \beta x'^2$$

Where from a continuous beta function $\beta(s)$, the  Twiss parameters can be fully derived:

$$\alpha(s) = -\frac{1}{2}\beta'(s) \qquad \gamma(s) = \frac{1+\alpha(s)^2}{\beta(s)}$$

We can incorporate particle dispersion $\delta$ when also provided with the dispersion function $D(s)$:

$$u(s) = u_\beta + u_D= \sqrt{\beta\epsilon}\cos\phi + D\delta$$

A bivariate transverse distribution x-x', y-y', etc. can be statistically described by its covariance matrix $\Sigma$, the product of its ``root-mean-square" emittance $\epsilon$ and the Twiss matrix $\Omega$, encapsulating the focusing properties of the present optics.

$$\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}<x^2> & <xx'> \\ <x'x>& <x'^2>\end{bmatrix} = \epsilon\Omega \qquad \Omega = \begin{bmatrix}\beta &-\alpha \\ -\alpha & \gamma\end{bmatrix} \qquad \epsilon = \sqrt{\det(\Sigma)}$$

Such that an injected particle distribution's covariance matrix matches that of the optics $\Omega$, the collective motion of the bunch will be such that the beam width throughout the ring can be described by:

$$\begin{aligned}
        \sigma^2_x(s) & = \beta_x(s)\epsilon_x+D(s)^2\sigma_\delta^2 \\
        \sigma^2_y(s) & = \beta_y(s)\epsilon_y
    \end{aligned}$$

As consistent in Figure \ref{fig:ps_transverse_tracking}, individual particle trajectories are seen in faded chaotic paths whereas the bulk group motion of the bunch width is seen to be defined by the net behavior on account of the optics for a matched distribution.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/ps_aperture.multivariate.pdf}
    \caption{Betatron "breathing" of transverse (x-x', y-y') distribution matched to PS Optics}
    \label{fig:ps_transverse_tracking}
\end{figure}

\section{Longitudinal Motion}

\subsection{Single Particle Motion}

\subsubsection{Energy Kick}

In longitudinal motion, our phase-space can be defined by time-momentum or phase-energy coordinates. In phase-space relative to the synchronous particle, as demonstrated by subscripted s, our coordinates are defined as follows:

$$\tau = t - t_s \qquad \delta = \frac{p-p_s}{p_s} \qquad \phi = \varphi - \varphi_s \qquad w = W-W_s$$

A particle accelerated in an RF gap gains energy according to \textbf{Panofsky-Wendzell} theorem , $\Delta W=qV_g\sin\varphi$ where for relative coordinates, we have:

$$\Delta w = q V_g(\sin\varphi-\sin\varphi_s)=q V(\tau)$$

Where our effective voltage is given by $V(\tau) = V_g g(\phi)$ with gap voltage $V_g$ and relative phase given by $\phi = h\omega_s\tau$, the RF field gradient $g(\phi)$ is given by $g(\phi)=\sin(\phi+\varphi_s)-\sin\varphi_s$ so that $g'(\phi)=\cos(\varphi_s-\phi)$ and $G(\phi)=(1-\cos\phi)\cos\varphi_s+(\sin\phi-\phi)\sin\varphi_s$.

\subsubsection{Particle Drift}

In a drift a particles revolution period $T$ evolves with energy $E$ given by:

$$\frac{dT}{T} = \frac{\eta}{\beta^2}\frac{dE}{E} \qquad \eta =\alpha- \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \qquad \alpha = \frac{dC/C}{dp/p} = \frac{1}{\gamma_t^2}$$

where our slippage factor $\eta$ is given by the momentum compaction factor $\alpha$ and the particle's Lorentz factor $\gamma$ defined by it's transition energy $\gamma_t$.

For convenience, we define:

$$\kappa = \frac{\eta}{\beta_s^2E_s} $$

Our equations of motion are therefore defined by:

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\tau} = \kappa w \qquad \dot{w} = \frac{qV(\tau)}{T_s}
    \label{eq:eom}
\end{equation}

For a linear applied voltage $V(\tau) \approx V'(\tau)\tau$, we can define our phase equation by simple harmonic motion, oscillating and frequency $\Omega$ by:

$$\ddot{\tau}+\Omega^2\tau = 0 \qquad \Omega^2 = -\frac{\kappa q}{T_s}V'(\tau)$$

Therefore we can scale accordingly that the amplitude of our synchrotron oscillation frequency varies as the square of the voltage gradient:

$$\Omega \propto \sqrt{V'(\tau)}$$

\subsubsection{Small Amplitude Oscillations}

For low amplitude oscillations where $\phi \to 0$, $g'(\phi) \approx \cos\varphi_s$ and so $V'(\tau)\approx h\omega_s V_g \cos\varphi_s$. Thus for a single RF gap of harmonic $h$ and voltage $V_g$, the particle motion follows that of a simple harmonic oscillator, defined by the Synchrotron Frequency $\Omega_s$ such that:

\begin{equation}
    \Omega_s^2 = -\frac{h\omega_s^2\eta}{\beta_s^2\gamma_s}\frac{qV_g}{2\pi}\cos\varphi_s
    \label{eq:synchrotron_frequency}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Hamiltonion}

Our equations of motion can be derived from the following Hamiltonion:

$$\begin{aligned}
        H & = \frac{1}{2}\kappa w^2 -\frac{q}{T_s}\int V(\tau)d\tau \\
          & = \frac{1}{2}\kappa w^2 -\frac{q V_g}{2\pi h}G(\phi)
    \end{aligned}$$

such that Hamilton's equations are followed:

$$\frac{dH}{dw} = \dot{\tau} \qquad -\frac{dH}{d\tau} = \dot{w}$$

We can then re-write our trajectories as a function of the particles conserved hamiltonion value as functions of oscillation amplitudes $\hat{\tau}$ and $\hat{w}$.

$$H = -\frac{qV_g}{2\pi h}G(\hat{\phi}) = \frac{1}{2}\kappa \hat{w}^2$$

$$w(\tau) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{\kappa}\left(H+\frac{q}{T_s}\int V(\tau) d\tau\right)}$$

Which for $\dot{\phi} = h\omega_s\dot{\tau}$ and $W(\phi) = G(\phi)/\cos\varphi_s$, we can re-write our particle trajectories as:

$$\dot{\phi} = \Omega_s\sqrt{2(W(\hat{\phi})-W(\phi))}$$

We can see these trajectories visualized for the example in Figure \ref{fig:fisheye} where particles towards the center with small oscillation amplitudes $\hat{\tau}$ retain elliptical trajectories whereas particles with larger values in $\hat{\tau}$ experience non-linear and asymmetric RF forces, yielding a "fish-eye" shape.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/single_particle_motion/trajectories.pdf}
    \caption{Particle trajectories circulating along Hamiltonian contours}
    \label{fig:fisheye}
\end{figure}

The separatrix defines the local maximum of the Hamiltonian contour such that within, particles will retain stable, confined trajectories. Particles injected outside the separatrix will follow unstable trajectories.

\subsection{Tune Spread}

The synchrotron period of a particle's phase-space oscillation $\Pi$ as a function of oscillation amplitude $\hat{\phi}$, is computed via:

$$\Pi(\hat{\phi}) = \oint dt = \oint \frac{d\phi}{\dot{\phi}} = \frac{2}{\Omega_s}\int_{\phi_L}^{\phi_R} \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{2(W(\hat{\phi})-W(\phi))}}$$

For \textbf{non-accelerating bucket} where $\varphi_s = 0$, $G(\phi) \to \cos\varphi_s(1-\cos\phi)$, $\phi_R = \hat{\phi}$ and $\phi_L = -\hat{\phi}$ yielding:

$$\Pi(\hat{\phi}) = \frac{4}{\Omega_s\sqrt{2}}\int_0^{\hat{\phi}}\frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{\cos\phi-\cos\hat{\phi}}} = \frac{4K(\hat{\phi}/2; k=\csc(\hat{\phi}/2))}{\Omega_s}$$

Defining the normalized synchrotron tune $\mu$ via $\mu = \Omega(\hat{\phi})/\Omega_s$ yields:

\begin{equation}
    \mu =\frac{\pi}{2K(\frac{\hat{\phi}}{2})} \approx 1-\frac{\hat{\phi}^2}{16} \qquad \phi \approx 4\sqrt{1-\mu}
    \label{eq:tune_spread}
\end{equation}

Accordingly, a distribution of linear charge density $\lambda(\phi)$ corresponds to a spread in normalized synchrotron tune $\mu$.

\input{tables/tune_distribution.tex}

Consistent with theoretical formula as in Table \ref{tab:freq_spread}, we observe the following tune spread distribution in Figure \ref{fig:tune_spread}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/single_particle_motion/normalized_tune.png}
    \caption{Impact of oscillation amplitude and synchrotron tune}
    \label{fig:tune_spread}
\end{figure}

\section{Longitudinal Space Charge}

\subsection{Wakefields}

Consider a particle trailing behind other particles within a bunch. This particle will experience a voltage change due to the propagated electric field of the ahead particles, named the wake. A particle's induced voltage is given by the convolution of the linear charge density $\lambda(\tau)$ and this wake function $\mathcal{W}(\tau)$ \cite{wiedemann_particle_2015}\cite{zotter_impedances_1998}.

$$\Delta V(\tau)=-\int_0^\infty\lambda(t)\mathcal{W}(\tau-t)dt=-\mathcal{W}*\lambda$$

Where a bunch's longitudinal charge profile $\lambda(\tau)$ is normalized to the total charge $Q$:

$$Q = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \lambda(\tau) d\tau$$

We can define an impedance $Z(f)$ and spectrum $S(f)$ from the Fourier transforms of the wakefunction $\mathcal{W}(\tau)$ and charge profile $\lambda(\tau)$ respectively:

$$\begin{aligned}
    Z(f)&=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\mathcal{W}(\tau)e^{-i\omega\tau}d\tau \\
    S(f)&=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\lambda(\tau)e^{-i\omega\tau}d\tau
\end{aligned}$$

The convolution of the wakefunction and linear charge density can be written as the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the spectrum and the impedance, therefore the induced voltage can be re-written as:

$$\Delta V(\tau)=-\int_{-\infty}^\infty S(f)Z(f)e^{i\omega \tau}df$$

For a linear impedance source where $n = f/f_s$ so that $Z/n$ is constant, the impedance can be separated from the integral so that the inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum can be re-written as the derivative of the linear charge density:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta V=\frac{-i}{\omega_s}\frac{Z}{n}\frac{d\lambda}{d\tau}
    \label{eq:induced_voltage}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Space Charge Impedance}

The relativistic self fields of a particle in a slowly varying coasting beam can be defined by \cite{ferrario_space_2014}:

$$E_z=-\frac{\bar{g}}{2\pi\epsilon_0\gamma^2}\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial z}$$

Where the \textbf{geometry factor} \ref{eq:longitudinal_self_fields} $\bar{g}$ is defined by:

$$\bar{g}=\int_r^b\frac{f(r')}{r'}dr'\qquad f(r)=\frac{\int_0^r\rho(r')r'dr'}{\int_0^\infty\rho(r')r'dr'}=\frac{Q'}{Q}$$

Where Q' defines the amount of charge enclosed within the radius $r$. About a turn, these self fields will induce a voltage that can be defined as the \textbf{longitudinal space charge impedance} given by \cite{lee_accelerator_2004}:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{Z}{n} = -i\frac{Z_0}{\beta\gamma^2}\bar{g}
    \label{eq:space_charge_impedance}
\end{equation}

This space-charge impedance can therefore be used to characterize the effect voltage drop of particles within a bunch by combing Equations \ref{eq:induced_voltage} and  \ref{eq:space_charge_impedance} to yield our induced voltage $\Delta V$ as a function of the derivative of linear charge density profile and the geometry factor.

$$\Delta V = -\frac{d\lambda}{d\tau}\frac{Z_0}{\beta_s\gamma_s^2}\frac{\bar{g}}{\omega_s}$$

The geometry factors as a function of transverse radial position $g(r)$ for a uniform (\ref{eq:g_uniform}), parabolic (\ref{eq:g_parabolic}) and gaussian (\ref{eq:g_gaussian}) are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:geometry_factors}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{./figs/geometric_factors.pdf}
    \caption{Charge Profiles with Subsequent Geometric Factors}
    \label{fig:geometry_factors}
\end{figure}

We observe that the resulting geometric factors used to represent the self fields of particles in or outside equivalently sized uniform, parabolic or gaussian are mostly equivalent.

The geometry factor for an on-axis particle ($r=0$) in a uniform circular bunch of radius $a$ in conducting aperture $b$ is given by:

$$\bar{g} = \frac{1}{2} + \ln\frac{b}{a} - \frac{1}2{}\frac{r^2}{a^2}$$

Indicating that the maximum geometry factor, corresponding to maximum space-charge effects occurs for particles near the center of the bunch at $r=0$. Particles with dispersion $\delta$ or larger transverse emittance $\epsilon_\perp$, will incur trajectories consuming an effective radial position greater than zero and therefore will incur reduce space-charge effects.

\subsection{Tune Shift}
Relevant to the oscillation frequency, it is also worth defining the space-charge impedance voltage gradient:

\begin{equation}
    V'_{SC}(\tau) = \frac{Z_0}{\beta\gamma^2}\frac{\bar{g}}{\omega_s}\frac{d^2\lambda}{d\tau^2}
\end{equation}

The normalized tune shift due to space-charge impedance can be defined by:
\begin{equation}
    \mu^2 = \frac{\Omega^2}{\Omega_s^2} = 1 + \frac{V'_{SC}}{V'_{RF}} = 1 + \frac{Z_0}{\beta\gamma^2}\frac{\bar{g}}{\omega_s}\frac{d^2\lambda}{d\tau^2}
    \label{eq:tune_shift}
\end{equation}

Consider a parabolic charge distribution defined between $\tau = \pm L_\tau/2$:

$$\lambda(\tau)=\frac{3Q}{2L_\tau}\left(1-4\frac{\tau^2}{L_\tau^2}\right)$$

The linear charge density is therefore defined by:

$$\frac{d\lambda}{d\tau} = \frac{-12Q}{L_\tau^3}\tau$$

The induced voltage gradient of a parabolic bunch due to space charge is given by Equation \ref{eq:vp_sc} \cite{lasheen_longitudinal_2016}. Because synchrotron frequency is proportional to the square of the voltage gradient, the effect of space-charge impedance is a frequency offset or shift such that $\Omega^2 \propto V'_{RF} + V'_{SC}$.

\begin{equation}
    V'_{SC} = -\frac{12Q}{\omega_s}\frac{\Im (Z)}{n}\frac{1}{L_\tau^3}=-\frac{12Q}{\omega_s}\frac{Z_0}{\beta_s\gamma_s^2}\frac{\bar{g}}{L_\tau^3}
    \label{eq:vp_sc}
\end{equation}

The effects of this space-charge impedance synchrotron frequency shift can be observed in the tune distributions seen in Figure \ref{fig:tune_shift}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/tune_shift/normalized_tune.png}
    \caption{Tune shift resulting from space-charge impedance of 30 ns gaussian bunch, 2.08e12 protons}
    \label{fig:tune_shift}
\end{figure}

Here we have assumed a constant space-charge geometry factor which fails to account for betatron motion variation and the non-uniform nature of the quasi-elliptical PS aperture.

\chapter{Aperture Reconstruction}

\section{Introduction}

As discussed in the previous chapter, the effects of longitudinal space-charge impedance is described in part by a characteristic geometry factor, describing the induced longitudinal fields due to the position a particle occupies transversely within a bunch distribution in a finite conducting aperture. To re-iterate, the geometry factor describing the longitudinal fields felt of a particle within a uniform circular bunch can be described by:

$$\bar{g}(r) = \frac{1}{2} + \ln\frac{b}{a}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{r^2}{a^2}$$

Much of this work is based on accurately tracking and characterizing the $a$ and $r$ terms in this equation, however the beam aperture $b$ and it's precision in its modeling relative to reality is in need of revision.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/ps_aperture.pdf}
    \caption{Model of PS Aperture from 2013}
    \label{fig:ps_aperture_model}
\end{figure}

The most recent model, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ps_aperture_model}, is not only old but only assumes elliptical geometries. Though this is mostly valid for most of the ring, being an elliptical beam pipe of 35 x 70 mm wide, there are additional cross sections and features of varying components such as septa, bellows, pump-out ports, etc. whose electrical boundaries aren't incorporated into this model.

\section{Intersection Algorithm}

The PS and it's sub-assemblies can be conveniently represented as triangular meshes, portable in STL (stereo-lithography) files, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ps_mu}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/ps_magnet.png}
    \caption{Triangular mesh representations of a PS Dipole (Magnet Unit)}
    \label{fig:ps_mu}
\end{figure}

The objective is to define a reference-trajectory $R(\phi)$ in curvilinear coordinates consistent with a "Frenet-Serret" coordinate system ($r,\theta,\phi$) such that a torus can be "inflated" until collision with the electrical aperture of the model. Where:

$$\begin{aligned}
        x & = (R(\phi)+r\cos\theta)\cos\phi \\
        y & = (R(\phi)+r\cos\theta)\sin\phi \\
        z & = r\sin\theta
    \end{aligned}$$

and $R(\phi)$ as the reference radius is defined by the geometry of 100 sectors comprised of 100 straight sections (SS) and 100 magnet units (MU)

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/reference_trajectory_path.jpg}
    \caption{Engineering drawing describing the reference trajectory a 36 $^\circ$ sector of the PS}
    \label{fig:ref_traj}
\end{figure}

We can use this definition of reference trajectory $R(\phi)$ to "unwrap' the PS ring into equivalent linear components as the PS was a LINAC. Our model coordinates therefore become Cartesian $(x, y, s)$ and so to detect the aperture, a cylinder originating about the reference trajectory needs to be "inflated" until an intersection between surfaces is detected and recorded.

\section{Moller-Trumbore}

We use the \textbf{Möller–Trumbore}\cite{moller_fast_1997} intersection algorithm to compute intersection angles with the PS. It is used in 3D graphics to efficiently detect and compute the intersection between light rays and polygons in a 3D environment. In Figure  \ref{fig:ray_casting}, a point source is cast through a spherical shell. The algorithm is able to evaluate each light ray with each face from the shell and determine if an intersection is possible and if so, where.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/ray_casting.png}
    \caption{Intersections of point source rays cast through spherical shell}
    \label{fig:ray_casting}
\end{figure}

After making linear the 3D PS model, a line ray source was generated along the central beam path whose ray intersections where detected. This produced an updated and detailed aperture as depicted in \ref{fig:ps_aperture}. The distinctive colors of the newly defined aperture coincide with a preservation for component granularity, being able to attribute specific aperture coordinates along the beam path with a particle magnet unit or straight section, allowing for easy verification.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/ps_aperture.png}
    \caption{Depiction of horizontal beam aperture of the PS}
    \label{fig:ps_aperture}
\end{figure}

By using this automated technique as opposed to a manual aperture accounting, details could be queried at much higher longitudinal resolutions, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ps_aperture_hi_res}. Additionally, features for smaller and yet frequent discrepancies could be automatically identified as in the case of pump-out ports and bellows and cavities as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ps_septa}.

Its optics are periodic and described in Figure \ref{fig:ps_optics}.

    \caption{Transverse optics of the PS}
    \label{fig:ps_optics}
\end{figure}

For simplicity of tracking purposes, the periodicity of these optics can be represented closely with a two-term Fourier series such that:

\begin{equation}
    \beta(\theta) \approx \sum_k \beta_k e^{i k\theta} \qquad D(\theta) \approx \sum_k D_k e^{i k\theta}
    \label{eq:optics_decomposition}
\end{equation}

The coefficients describing the PS optics to first order are described in Table \ref{tab:ps_optics_fourier} as consistent with Equations \ref{eq:optics_decomposition}. This approximation helped in reducing the computation time for the subsequent transverse tracking simulations.

\input{tables/ps_optics.tex}

A transverse tracker was developed to solve for betatron trajectories described by solutions to Hill's Equations (Equation  \ref{eq:hills_equations} ). A bivariate gaussian distribution with matching covariance matrix $\Sigma$ to that of the PS's Twiss matrix $\Omega$ was "injected" and then tracked about one turn in the synchrotron as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:trans_tracking}.

\subsection{Effective Geometry Factor}

Given the ability to track the transverse locations of particles propagating through the PS lattice relative to the transverse particle distribution itself, each particle's geometry factor can be computed and observed to vary along the ring. These geometry factors can be averaged resulting in the definition of the effective geometry factor, characterizing the particle's turn-averaged experienced space-charge, dependent on the optics, aperture, and the particle's characteristic emittance, phase advance and dispersion.

$$g_{EFF} \propto g(\epsilon_\perp, \mu_0, \delta)$$

The transverse tracker was accordingly used to build a response matrix to predict a particle's effective geometry factor given it's initial conditions. In relation to dispersion, Figure \ref{fig:g_eff_dispersion} shows a parabolic dependence with the effective geometry factor and a linear relationship with transverse emittance and minimal impact on phase-advance.

$$g_{eff} \propto g_{max} - C_0\delta^2 - C_1\epsilon_x - C_2\epsilon_y$$

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/g_dispersion.pdf}
    \caption{Impact of particle \textbf{dispersion} on effective geometry factor}
    \label{fig:g_eff_dispersion}
\end{figure}

We see however that the domain for $g_{eff}$ is limited as particles with a combination of very high dispersion and/or very high emittance are likely to collide with the beam aperture and are counted as lost particles. This phenomena is more readily visible in Figure \ref{fig:g_emittance} where we see thicker lines where dispersion is higher end up being foreshortened with increased transverse emittance. This figure also makes it more clear the exponential relationship between strictly emittance the the geometric factor, however the inclusion of dispersion complicates this relationship.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/g_emittance.pdf}
    \caption{Impact of particle \textbf{emittance} on effective geometry factor}
    \label{fig:g_emittance}
\end{figure}

We see in Figure \ref{fig:g_phase_advance} that though changes in geometry factor are dominated by dispersion and particle emittance, along the course of a particle around it's elliptical trajectory in transverse phase-space, there will e a quasi-sinusoidal impact on the geometry factor due to phase-advance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/g_phase_advance.pdf}
    \caption{Impact of particle \textbf{phase advance} on effective geometry factor}
    \label{fig:g_phase_advance}
\end{figure}


This complicated relationship can be summarized in a lookup table or response matrix and visualized in Figure \ref{fig:g_eff_vol}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/g_eff.surface.0.pdf}
    \caption{Multi-dimensional vector space of effective geometry factor}
    \label{fig:g_eff_vol}
\end{figure}

The impact of particle phase-advance was neglected as it's effect is minimal in comparison to the other dependencies on account of the fact that the transverse tune large and accordingly a variation in a particle's initial phase-offset will contribute to little variance in the particle's effective radial position.

\section{Longitudinal Tracking}

\subsection{Usage of Geometric Factor}

A longitudinal tracker can be developed by discretizing Equations \ref{eq:eom}, yielding the turn-by=turn "kick" and "drift" components.

$$\Delta w = qV(\tau) \qquad \Delta\tau = \kappa T_s w$$

To include space-charge in our tracker, our effective applied is the combination of RF voltage and space-charge impedance.

$$V(\tau) = V_{RF} + V_{SC}$$

where now we replace $\bar{g}$ as found in Equation \ref{eq:space_charge_impedance} with the effective particle dependent geometry factor $g_{eff}$ for a parabolic longitudinal bunch given by:

$$V_{SC} = -\frac{12Q}{L_\tau^2}\frac{Z_0}{\beta\gamma^3}\frac{g_{eff}(\epsilon_x,\epsilon_y,\delta)}{\omega_s}$$

Transverse emittance $\epsilon_x$ and $\epsilon_y$ is presumed to be preserved between synchrotron "kicks", however dispersion evolves and accordingly the geometry factor will notice an influence as the particle orbits in longitudinal phase-space.

\subsection{Tune Blur}

Consider we sample our distribution from a 6D ellipsoidal distribution coordinated with gaussian transverse emittance, uniform phase advance and gaussian dispersion and bunch length. Using this modified longitudinal tracker, the normalized tune distribution incorporating the effective geometry factor due to transverse motion is given by \ref{fig:tune_blurr}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/tune_blurr/blurred_tune.png}
    \caption{Blurred Synchrotron Frequency spread distribution due to space-charge impedance with transverse motion}
    \label{fig:tune_blurr}
\end{figure}

To improve tracking statistics and make more visible the phenomena, Figure \ref{fig:full_comparison} compares the three test cases of synchrotron motion.

The particles depicted are selected "ghost" particles visualized within a non-oscillating matched bunch. Accordingly, the derivative term related to the longitudinal profile is non-varying as the longitudinal profile is stable. Nonetheless we observe originally the deviation between single-particle motion and space-charge impedance in a non-linear coherent synchrotron frequency shift.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/tune_blurr/trajectories.png}
    \caption{Comparison of synchrotron motion of "ghost particles" in a matched bunch for single-particle motion (blue), coherent space-charge impedance (orange) and incoherent space-charge impedance (green)}
    \label{fig:full_comparison}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, by incorporating an additionally nuanced transverse motion, we observe a "blurring" of the particles synchrotron frequency shift on account of the variance in particle's space-charge impedance. Though particles may occupy the same location in longitudinal phase-space, each particle's unique dispersion, emittance and phase-advance will modify it's respective kick differently and therefore it's revolution period along hamiltonion contours will vary.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/tune_blurr/normalized_tune.png}
    \caption{Blurring of synchrotron oscillation frequency due to Transverse Motion}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bunch Stability}

A standard \textbf{dipole} measurement to determine the synchrotron frequency is to observe the bunch length contraction frequency of a bunch injected with an offset. Accordingly we can observe how an offset bunch will oscillate about the bucket center, bunch length oscillating until it reaches a stable larger value as synchrotron motion has sufficiently filamented the mismatched distribution to that of a matched distribution with higher geometric emittance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/dipole_oscillation.png}
    \caption{\textbf{BLonD} simulation of dipole oscillations}
\end{figure}

Tune blurring may increase the observed filamentation rate of our distribution. Filamentation as a fundamental phenomena in synchrotron motion, is frequently associated as a stabilizing effect as mismatched bunches or coherent bunch perturbations will be eventually spread along Hamiltonian contours until they decohere. Therefore, it is reasonable t to suspect that the impact of transverse motion on longitudinal space-charge impedance may provide additional stability to longitudinal motion.

\chapter{Conclusions}

\section{PS Experiments}

And attempt to measure the phenomena of "tune blurring" with \textbf{MD} experiments at \textbf{flat bottom} where conducted with the following baseline parameters for the PS:

\input{tables/md_parameters.tex}

Bunch length and instability measurements can be used to characterize and identify the synchrotron frequency \cite{sacherer_bunch_1977}. A bunch with a mismatch but no offset will also contract in accordance with the bunch length. This forms a \textbf{quadrupole} oscillation in bunch length which can be measured and interpreted to yield information for the distributions synchrotron frequency.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/injosc.14x144.dat.npy.png}
    \caption{MD Results of bunch length oscillations}
\end{figure}

However, the oscillations in bunch length being measured are of the particles with large oscillation amplitudes as the bulk of the bunch towards the center of the phase-space distribution will oscillate slowly and with small amplitudes, being difficult to resolve and so the frequency being probed is merely correlated of the peak synchrotron frequency.

The analysis of these measurements were inconclusive as intrinsic instabilities incorporated a high variance between like measurements as well did the beam become unstable at higher bunch intensities. It would still however be potentially fruitful to further conduct these measurements over a longer period of time so that the additional synchrotron oscillations measured may provide sufficient detail to quantify the effect of transverse motion on filamentation rate.

\section{Summary}

It has been shown in theory that the unique motion of a particle's betatron trajectories will provide additional variance to the applied induced voltage due to space-charge impedance. This effect, when capture adequately in longitudinal tracking codes, yields an observed "blurring" of the synchrotron frequency distribution when compared to that expected for the strictly longitudinal case. The observed tune blur leads to an increased filamentation rate and accordingly should increase the dampening rate of quadrupole motion in a perturbed longitudinal distribution. Attempts to measure this filamentation rate variation were attempted however further work must be conducted to ensure data is acquired over a sufficiently long acquisition period so that an oscillating bunch can be observed to stabilize and provide insight to the filamentation rate.
